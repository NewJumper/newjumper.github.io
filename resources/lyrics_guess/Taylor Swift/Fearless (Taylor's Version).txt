Fearless (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fеarless
[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this onе-horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh
[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
It's fearless
Oh, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
[Outro]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, yeah
Fifteen (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen
[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends
[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Datin' the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen
[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now
[Verse 3]
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
But I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen
[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
[Outro]
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
Love Story (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
[Chorus]
And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"
[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
Hey Stephen (Taylor’s Version)=
[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah
[Verse 1]
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceivin'
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talkin'
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believin'
I don't always have to be alone
[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mmm
Oh-woah, mmm
[Verse 2]
Hey Stephen, I've been holdin' back this feelin'
So I've got some things to say to you, huh
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leavin'?
I think you and I should stay the same
[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm
[Bridge]
They're dimming the street lights
You're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waitin' alone now
So come on and come out
And pull me near
And shine, shine, shine
[Verse 3]
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? Haha
[Chorus]
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
[Outro]
Oh-oh, myself
Mmm, I can't help myself
I can't help myself, oh-oh-oh
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
White Horse (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
[Pre-Chorus]
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
Well, my mistakе, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have thе upper hand
[Pre-Chorus]
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, well now I know
[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
[Outro]
Oh, woah, woah, woah
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now
You Belong With Me (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's goin' off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You bеlong with me, you belong with me
[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinking to myself
"Hey, isn't this easy?"
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doin' with a girl like that?
[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standin' by and waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you
Driving to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me
[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see? (Ah)
You belong with me
Standin' by and waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought, just maybe you belong with me?
You belong with me
Breathe (feat. Colbie Caillat) (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
[Verse 3: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
[Bridge: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh-oh
[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
[Outro: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Tell Me Why (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are
[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feelin' like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
[Verse 2]
Well, you could write a book on
How to ruin someone's perfеct day
Well, I get so confused and frustratеd
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh-oh
[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
[Bridge]
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?
[Chorus]
Well, I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Feelin' like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me and cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
[Post-Chorus]
Why
Tell me why, oh
[Outro]
I take a step back, I let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know
You’re Not Sorry (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
All this time, I was wastin', hopin' you would come around
I've been givin' out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinkin' we'll be fine again, but not this time around
[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, no, no
[Verse 2]
You're lookin' so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waitin' in the cold
And you've got your sharе of secrets and I'm tired of bein' last to know, oh
And now you're askin' me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no
You're not sorry
No, no
[Bridge]
You had me crawlin' for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade
[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothin' left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no
You're not sorry
No, no
[Outro]
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no
No, no
The Way I Loved You (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear
And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
[Pre-Chorus]
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
And I feel perfectly fine
[Chorus]
But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name
So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and comin' undone
It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
[Chorus]
But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name
So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and comin' undone
It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
[Bridge]
He can't see the smile I'm fakin'
And my heart's not breakin'
'Cause I'm not feelin' anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicatin', complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
[Chorus]
I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name
So in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and comin' undone
It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
[Outro]
Woah, woah, oh-oh
Oh, and that's the way I loved you
Oh, oh, oh-woah, oh, oh, oh-woah
Never knew I could feel that much
That's the way I loved you
Forever & Always (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto somethin'
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kiddin'?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause, one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always," oh
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothin'
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always," oh
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
[Post-Chorus]
You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so
Oh, woah
[Bridge]
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
[Outro]
You didn't mean it, baby
You said, "Forever and always," yeah
The Best Day (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it's gettin' cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smilin' at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides, look, now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
[Chorus]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home cryin' and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
[Chorus]
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughin' on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today
[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talkin' to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
[Chorus]
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for givin' me your eyes
For staying back and watchin' me shine
And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today
Change (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits ya
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same, another time and place
Repeatin' history and you're gettin’ sick of it
[Pre-Chorus]
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
[Chorus]
Because these things will change, can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raidеd and, now, cornered
It's hard to fight when thе fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we’re faster and never scared
[Pre-Chorus]
You can walk away, say, "We don’t need this"
But there's somethin’ in your eyes, says, "We can beat this"
[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change, can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh-woah
[Bridge]
Tonight, we’ll stand and get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight
[Chorus]
It was the night things changed, can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up 'cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah, oh
[Outro]
Hallelujah
Jump Then Fall (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
I like the way you sound in the mornin'
We're on the phone and without a warnin'
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words, but all I can think is
"We should be together"
[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
[Chorus]
Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby
Don't be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
[Verse 2]
Huh, well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh-over
And all I can say is, "Come closer"
Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
[Chorus]
Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby
Don't be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
[Bridge]
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
[Chorus]
Woah-oh, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please, jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
Jump, then fall, baby
Jump, then fall into me, into me
[Outro]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump, then fall, jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me, into me, yeah
Untouchable (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reachin' out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
[Pre-Chorus]
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like comin' undone
[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of Heaven
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
[Verse 2]
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're sayin' that you'd be here anyway
[Pre-Chorus]
But you're untouchable, burnin' brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like comin' undone
[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night, wakin' from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side, standin' next to me
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of Heaven
[Post-Chorus]
I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
But you're untouchable, burnin' brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like comin' undone
[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night, wakin' from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side, standin' next to me
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of Heaven
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
And in the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
You gotta come on, come on, oh
Come on, come on, come on, come on
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Outro]
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
Spellin' out your name, oh
Forever & Always (Piano Version) (Taylor’s Version)=
[Taylor’s Version] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto somethin'
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
What happened? Please, tell me
'Cause, one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
You flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
[Post-Chorus]
You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so
Oh, oh-woah
Oh, oh-oh
[Bridge]
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Please, back up, oh, back up
Back up, baby, back up
[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
You flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here, it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
[Outro]
You didn't mean it, baby
You said, "Forever and always," yeah
Come In With The Rain (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore
[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
[Chorus]
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know, I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain
[Verse 2]
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start
[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear
[Chorus]
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name, oh
Just know, I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain
[Bridge]
I've watched you so long
Screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say
[Chorus]
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know, I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain
[Outro]
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
Superstar (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
This is wrong, but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothin' more right, babe
Misty mornin' comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
I knew from the first note played
I'd be breakin' all my rules to see you
[Pre-Chorus]
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
"I can't keep my eyes off of you"
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
[Verse 2]
Mornin' lonelinеss comes around when I'm not
Dreamin' about you
Whеn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
[Pre-Chorus]
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
"I can't take my eyes off of you"
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
[Bridge]
You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio
[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
"I can't take my eyes off of you"
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
[Outro]
Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar
The Other Side Of The Door (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignorin' words that you were sayin', tryna make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not pickin' up
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
[Verse 2]
Well, me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said
And I remember the slammin' door
And all the things that I misread
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah
[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
[Bridge]
And I'll scream out the window
"I can't even look at you"
I don't need you, but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothin' you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
But what I mean is
[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
[Outro]
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down cryin', was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess
I need you
Today Was A Fairytale (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray T-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
[Chorus]
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
[Verse 2]
Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
Is, now it's gettin' so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah
[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
[Bridge]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down
[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
[Outro]
Oh, oh, yeah, woah
Today was a fairytale
You All Over Me (feat. Maren Morris) (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)=
[Verse 1]
Once the last drop of rain
Has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do
The way the tires turn stones
On old county roads
They leave it muddy underneath
Reminds me of you
[Verse 2]
You find graffiti on the walls
Of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it off
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket
That's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me
[Chorus]
And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, held on
God knows too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Sworе that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gеts you clean
I've still got you all over me
[Verse 3]
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin
I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now, every breath of air I breathe
Reminds me of back then
[Chorus]
And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows too long
And wasted my time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around see
That we were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I tried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
[Outro]
I've still got you all, oh-oh, over me
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
La-da-dum, la-da-dum
La-da-da-da, all over me
Da-da-dum, la-la-da
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na
All over you, you all over me
Ah-oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, ah, oh
All over me
Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)=
[From the Vault] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mr. "Perfect face," Mr. "Here to stay"
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
Everything was right, Mr. "I've been waitin' for you all my life"
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"
[Pre-Chorus]
But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay
[Chorus]
Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
[Verse 2]
Mr. "Never told me why," Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
Mr. "Insincere apology, so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
He goes about his day, forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same
[Pre-Chorus]
Because I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you
[Chorus]
Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
[Bridge]
So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay your way to your seat
It's the best seat in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins"
So far above me in every sense
So far above feelin' anything
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay"
Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday"
And someday, maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late"
[Chorus]
Goodbye, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Goodbye, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery for the last time
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
[Outro]
You're perfectly fine
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
You said you'd never go away
We Were Happy (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)=
[From the Vault] Lyrics[Verse 1]
We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shinin' bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy
I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy
[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
[Verse 2]
We used to watch the Sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy
[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
[Post-Chorus]
We were happy
[Bridge]
Oh, I hate those voices
Tellin' me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were happy
We were happy
[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
[Outro]
We were happy
Oh, we were happy
That’s When (feat. Keith Urban) (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)=
[Intro: Brett Warren &  Taylor Swift ]
You ready? Yeah, let's try
One, two, three, four
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I said, "I know"
When he said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
And I watched him go
And he watched me crash to the floor
On my knees, just like that
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Then he said, "When can I-I-I come back?"
I said
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Warren Brothers]
"That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, if I see your face, I'll let you in
Yeah, baby, that's when"
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I said, "I know"
When he said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this”
'Cause I let you go, and you let me
Think that I'd be fine without you, imagine that
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
So, baby, when can I come back?
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Warren Brothers]
That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, if I see your face, I'll let you in
And baby, that's when
[Interlude: Brad Warren]
Do a bridge right here
[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
And I said, "Honestly
Did you ever think of me?"
And he said
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Warren Brothers]
"That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's storming
When I was laughing, when I was crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, if I see your face, you let me in
And baby, that's when”
[Outro: Brad Warren, Taylor Swift, Both]
That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's, oh-oh-oh, storming
Oh-oh-oh-oh, laughing, crying
Ah-ah, oh-oh That's when
Oh-oh-oh That's when
Oh-oh I'll let you in
Baby, that's when
I said, "I know"
When he said, "I need some time, need some space"
Don’t You (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)=
[From the Vault] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy
[Chorus]
But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?
[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this
[Chorus]
But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?
[Bridge]
So I'll walk out of here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say we're still friends
(But I don't wanna pretend)
So if I see you again
[Chorus]
Don't you (Don't you)
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you (Don't you) say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't (You don't) know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?
[Outro]
Don't you
Bye Bye Baby (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)=
[From the Vault] Lyrics[Verse 1]
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you, but I can't
[Chorus]
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, baby
[Verse 2]
The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past
[Chorus]
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby
[Bridge]
And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want, but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends
[Chorus]
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
[Chorus]
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, baby
