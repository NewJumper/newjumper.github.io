You’re Losing Me (From The Vault)=
[Verse 1]
You say, "I don't understand," and I say, "I know you don't"
We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
Remember lookin' at this room? We loved it 'cause of the light
Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time
[Pre-Chorus]
Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes
Mendin' all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow
[Chorus]
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me
[Verse 2]
Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick
[Pre-Chorus]
And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're runnin' down the hallway
And you know what they all say
"You don't know what you got until it's gone"
[Chorus]
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me
'Cause you're losin' me
Stop (Stop) 'cause you're losin' me
[Post-Chorus]
My heart won't start anymore
(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)
My heart won't start anymore
(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)
[Bridge]
How long could we be a sad song
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party (You're losin' me)
And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And I'm fadin', thinkin'
"Do something, babe, say something" (Say something)
"Lose something, babe, risk something" (You're losin' me)
"Choose something, babe, I got nothing" (I got nothing)
"To believe, unless you're choosin' me"
[Outro]
You're losin' me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore
The Joker And The Queen (feat. Taylor Swift)=
[Verse 1]
How was I to know? It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together
[Chorus]
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
[Verse 2]
I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever
[Chorus]
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would givе you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the bеst in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen
Safe & Sound (feat. Joy Williams and John Paul White) (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I remember tears streaming down your face when I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Joy Williams of The Civil Wars backup]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with John Paul White of The Civil Wars backup]
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when (the) music's gone
Gone
[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
[Bridge: Taylor Swift with The Civil Wars backup]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh
Oh
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Civil Wars]
Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
[Outro: Taylor Swift with The Civil Wars backup]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Eyes Open (Taylor's Version)=
[Intro]
Everybody's waitin'
Everybody's watchin'
Even when you're sleepin'
Keep your eyes open
[Verse 1]
The tricky thing
Is yesterday, we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards
Winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
[Pre-Chorus]
(Keep your eyes open)
[Chorus]
Everybody's waitin' for you to break down
Everybody's watchin' to see the fallout
Even when you're sleepin', sleepin'
Keep your eyes open
[Post-Chorus]
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
[Verse 2]
So here you are
Two steps ahead and stayin' on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (Turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown (Showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got somethin' they don't
Yeah, you got somethin' they don't
[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta keep your eyes open
[Chorus]
Everybody's waitin' for you to break down
Everybody's watchin' to see the fallout
Even when you're sleepin', sleepin'
Keep your eyes open
[Post-Chorus]
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes
[Bridge]
Keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
[Chorus]
Everybody's waitin' for you to break down
Everybody's watchin' to see the fallout
Even when you're sleepin', sleepin'
Keep your eyes open
[Post-Chorus]
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Renegade - Pop Version=
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
And if I would've known how many pieces you had crumbled into
I might have let them lay
[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Justin Vernon]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way; open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be thе first renegade to need somеbody
Is it insensitive for me to say, "Get your shit together so I can love you?"
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
You fire off missiles 'cause you hate yourself
But do you know you're demolishing me?
And then you squeeze my hand as I'm about to leave
[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Justin Vernon]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way; open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it insensitive for me to say, "Get your shit together so I can love you?"
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?
[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
And if I would've known
How sharp the pieces were you'd crumbled into
I might've let them lay
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way; open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
[Outro: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
To need somebody, to need somebody, to need somebody, to need
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
Is it insensitive for me to say, "Get your shit together so I can love you?"
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?
If This Was A Movie (Taylor’s Version)=
[Verse 1]
Last night, I heard my own heart beatin'
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reachin'
Even though I know you're not there
I was playin' back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you
[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose
[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
[Bridge]
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
[Breakdown]
And I say, "Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out"
But I take it all back now
[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
[Outro]
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought that you'd be here by now
Oh, oh
Thought you'd be here by now
Only The Young - Featured in Miss Americana=
[Verse 1]
It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they’re right
You were outnumbered this time
[Chorus]
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run
[Verse 2]
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget
[Pre-Chorus]
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun
[Chorus]
Only one thing can save us
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young; Don't say you're too tired to fight)
Only the young (Only the young; It's just a matter of time)
Only the young (Only the young; Up there's the finish line)
Only the young
Can run
[Post-Chorus]
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (Can run)
Up there's the finish line (So run, and run, and run)
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (So run)
Up there's the finish line (And run, and run, and run)
[Outro]
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young
Christmas Tree Farm=
[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic
[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too
[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow
[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too
[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah
[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)
[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you
All Of The Girls You Loved Before=
[Verse 1]
When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin' with someone
But feelin' alone
[Refrain]
A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
Sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killin' time
[Pre-Chorus]
Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me "baby"
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is
[Chorus]
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
[Verse 2]
When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now
[Refrain]
Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
Breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you "baby"
It's why you're so amazing
[Chorus]
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
[Bridge]
Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels
[Chorus]
Like the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (Dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)
Now you're all I need (All I need), I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
[Outro]
(I love you more)
(I love you more)
Sweeter Than Fiction - From "One Chance" Soundtrack=
[Verse 1]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh, oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is, "No"
You never saw it comin', slipped when you started runnin'
And now you've come undone, and I, I, I, I
[Pre-Chorus]
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh, ayy
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better, someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever
[Chorus]
There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
[Verse 2]
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh, oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it comin', you hit the ground runnin'
And now you're on to somethin', I, I, I say
[Pre-Chorus]
"What a sight, what a sight" when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And, in this perfect weather, it's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever
[Chorus]
There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you'll stand, next to me (Next to me)
All at once, the rest is history (Ooh)
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction (Sweeter than fiction)
[Bridge]
I'll be one of the many sayin'
"Look at you now, look at you now and now"
I'll be one of the many saying
"You've made us proud, you've made us proud, proud"
I'll be one of the many sayin'
"Look at you now, look at you now and now"
I'll be one of the many sayin'
"You've made us proud, you've made us proud, proud"
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you
[Pre-Chorus]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh, oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was, "No"
Now, in this perfect weather, it's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (Forever)
[Chorus]
There you'll stand, ten feet tall (Ten feet tall)
I will say, "I knew it all along" (Along)
Your eyes, wider than distance (I knew it all along)
This life is sweeter than fiction (Sweeter than fiction)
There you'll stand, next to me (Next to me)
All at once, the rest is history (Ooh)
Your eyes, wider than distance (I knew it all along)
This life is sweeter than fiction (It's sweeter than fiction)
[Outro]
It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter, it's sweeter
It's sweeter than fiction
