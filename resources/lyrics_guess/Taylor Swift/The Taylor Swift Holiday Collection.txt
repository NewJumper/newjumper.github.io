Last Christmas=
[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again
[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
[Verse 2]
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special
[Chorus]
Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Christmases When You Were Mine=
[Verse 1]
Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't want to think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell
[Chorus]
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine
[Verse 2]
I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold
[Chorus]
But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
[Verse 3]
Merry Christmas, everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?
[Chorus]
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
[Outro]
You were mine
Santa Baby=
[Chorus]
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I have been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I will wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah
[Verse 1]
Think of all the fun I have missed
Think of all the boys I have not kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list
[Chorus]
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
I have been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa, honey, there is one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight
[Verse 2]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let us see if you believe in me
[Chorus]
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Silent Night=
[Verse 1]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
[Verse 2]
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ our Saviour is born
[Verse 3]
Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth
[Outro]
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Christmas Must Be Something More=
[Verse 1]
What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Tell me, what would you find?
[Chorus]
You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
[Verse 2]
What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me, what would you find?
[Chorus]
You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
[Bridge]
We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred-mile-an-hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind
[Chorus]
Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more
[Outro]
There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more
White Christmas=
[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
[Intermission]
[Verse 3]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
[Outro]
May your days be merry and bright
