Overture=
[Intro]
These are our drums
This is our melody
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Now listen closely as our drums become our melody
And here's our song
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
[Verse 1]
So let me play my violin for you (Bang, bang, bang)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
So let me play my violin for you
The truth is that I'm screwed
Still, Joe, do you think I'm cool?
[Verse 2]
(One, two, one-one, two, three, four)
(One, two, one-one, two, three, four)
I got friends in a lot of weird places (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Wonder if they're gonna call, depending what my face is (Two, three, four)
I got friends in a lot of weird places (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Wonder if they're gonna call, depending what my facе is
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yеah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
[Verse 3]
Humpty Dumpty when, Humpty Dumpty when
Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one's around"
Humpty Dumpty when, Humpty Dumpty when
Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one, when no one
When no one's around, around, around, around"
[Interlude]
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
And I'll scream when no one, when no one, when no one's around
[Verse 4]
One day, maybe someday, I'll be so out of touch
I'll become a trumpet or a drum set in a sad orchestra
One day, maybe someday in a world speeding up
It's getting hard, so very hard to keep up
One day, maybe someday, I'll be so out of touch
I'll become a trumpet or a drum set
In a sad orchestra
One day, I won't know what to write
And I can't be eighteen my whole life
But I'm too fuckin' young to feel so fuckin' old
But I'll try and I'll try and I'll try
But I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright
[Outro]
Bang, bang, bang
But I'm way less sad
Adventure is out there
But you gotta be some—
Come on, guy
Bang, bang, bang
But it's all I have
Oh, I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright
The Good Part=
[Intro: Jack Met]
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Have I done my best here, or
Will I be here next year, or
Are these my best years yet?
Was looking forward to
Being important, but
I'm not important yet
[Chorus: Jack Met]
If you put this scene on a movie screen
Is it called a happy end?
If the work gets me where I'm supposed to be
Will I know I've made it then?
It's so hard
Can we skip to the good part?
[Post-Chorus: Jack Met]
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
If there's a good part, then
I hope it's not far 'cause
I thought it'd be today
I napped on campus and
I smoked at dances, but
It didn't feel so great
[Chorus: Jack Met]
If you put this scene on a movie screen
Is it called a happy end?
If the work gets me where I'm supposed to be
Will I know I've made it then?
It's so hard
So can we skip to the good part?
[Post-Chorus: Jack Met]
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four (So can we skip to the good part?)
Ah, ah-ah-ah (To the good part, to the good part)
One, two, three, four
Ah, ah-ah-ah (Woo, woo)
One, two, three, four
[Outro: Jack Met]
(Ah, ah-ah-ah)
(Ah, ah-ah-ah)
These things take time
Mom and Dad, they have a good life
But what am I gonna do with mine?
(Ah, ah-ah-ah)
These things take time
Mom and Dad, they have a good life
But what the hell am I gonna do with mine?
Weak=
[Verse 1]
"No thank you" is what I should've said
I should be in bed
But temptations of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come
[Pre-Chorus]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And "no thank you" is how it should've gone
I should stay strong
[Chorus]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
(Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that)
[Verse 2]
No thank you
They call me after dark, I don't want no part
My habits, they hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge
[Pre-Chorus]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And "no thank you" is how it should've gone
I should stay strong
[Chorus]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
[Bridge]
We, we fall for that
Wake up, we fall again
We, we fall for that
Can't wait to fall again
[Pre-Chorus]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you is how it should've gone
I should stay strong
[Chorus]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
Go!
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee yaaaaa
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee yaaaaa
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee yaaaaa
Sober Up (feat. Rivers Cuomo)=
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missin' me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Won't you help me sober up?
Growin' up, it made me numb
And I wanna feel somethin' again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel somethin' again (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Won't you help me feel somethin' again?
How's it go again?
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
"Goodbye, goodbye"
I said to my best-est buds
We said that we'd keep in touch
And we did our best
All my new friends
We smile at party time
But soon we forget to smile
At anything else
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Won't you help me sober up?
Growin' up, it made me numb
And I want to feel somethin' again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel somethin' again (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Won't you help me feel somethin' again?
How's it go again?
[Post-Chorus: Jack Met]
How's it go again? (Go again, go again, go again…)
[Bridge: Rivers Cuomo]
My favorite color is you
You're vibratin' out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be
My favorite color is you
You're vibratin' out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missin' me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
And I want to feel somethin' again
I just wanna feel somethin' again
How's it go again?
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Won't you help me sober up?
Growin' up, it made me numb
And I want to feel somethin' again (My favorite color is you)
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel somethin' again (My favorite color is you)
Won't you help me feel somethin' again? (My favorite color is you)
Can I finally feel somethin' again?
How's it go again?
Drama=
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
When did all my friends become so loud?
We act like reality shows
Probably 'cause reality blows
When did all my friends become so loud?
We traded our boring lives
For MTV story lines, why?
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Recently he said that she said that we said some shit that you wouldn't believe
Recently he said that she said that we said that he said some shit about me
[Chorus: Jack Met, All]
So we're caught up in drama
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking
We're caught up in problems
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking, ooh, ahh
Hold up, hold up, can we make it stop?
Hold up, hold up, but I'm so caught up in drama
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking now
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
When did all our problems get so small?
We break up with lovers and friends
Make love to the rumors instead
Maybe we're addicted to it all
The drama is dangerous
But it's so exciting to us
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Recently he said that she said that we said some shit that you wouldn't believe
Recently he said that she said that we said that he said some shit about me
[Chorus: Jack Met, All]
So we're caught up in drama
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking
We're caught up in problems
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking, ooh, ahh
Hold up, hold up, can we make it stop?
Hold up, hold up, but I'm so caught up in drama
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking now
[Bridge: Jack Met]
(Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
When did my friends get so loud?
(Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
When did my friends get so loud?
(Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
When did my friends get so loud?
(Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Oh, when did my friends get loud?
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Recently he said that she said that we said some shit that you wouldn't believe
Recently he said that she said that we said that he said some shit about me
[Chorus: Jack Met, All]
So we're caught up in drama
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking
We're caught up in problems
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking, ooh, aah (Everybody's talking)
Hold up, hold up, can we make it stop?
Hold up, hold up, but I'm so caught up in drama
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking now
Turning Out=
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
I hold you
I hold you closer than I ever knew
I could do
But I'm confused
I thought I'd recognize when love was true
But I'm confused
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Am I ready for love?
Or maybe just a best friend
Should there be a difference?
Do you have instructions?
Maybe I'm stuck on what I see on TV
I grew up on Disney
But this don't feel like Disney
[Chorus: Jack Met]
You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
I think I'm still turning out
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
In my mind
I thought the birds would sing and sparks would fly
But it's just quiet
Am I cruel?
Or am I ignorant or was I fooled
By the stories I knew
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Am I ready for love?
Or maybe just a best friend
Should there be a difference?
Do you have instructions?
Maybe I'm stuck on what I see on TV
I grew up on Disney
But this don't feel like Disney
[Chorus: Jack Met]
You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
You say I turned out fine
I think I'm still turning out
I hope you stick around
We're gonna figure it out
Who can I turn to now?
When I'm still turning out
When I'm still turning out
[Bridge: Jack Met]
I'm a little kid, and so are you
Don't you go and grow up before I do
I'm a little kid with so much doubt
Do you wanna be there to see how I turn out?
I'm a little kid, and so are you
Don't you go and grow up before I do
I'm a little kid with so much doubt
Do you wanna be there to see how I turn out?
I'm a little kid, and so are you
Don't you go and grow up before I do
I'm a little kid with so much doubt
Do you wanna be there to see how I turn out?
I'm a little kid, and so are you
Don't you go and grow up before I do
I'm a little kid with so much doubt
Do you want to be there to see how I turn out?
[Outro: Jack Met]
'Cause I'm still turning out
No Grass Today=
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Oh, I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s because I love to play
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Does the grass look greener (Greener)
On my side of the speakers (Speakers)
I tried a couple weekends
But that green’s not for me
I thought I’d get clever
Make my lyrics come out better
But at 7/11’s where you would find me
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Don’t wanna get paranoid
Just wanna be making noise
You want a hit, it’s your choice
But please enjoy the show
[Chorus: Jack Met]
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s because I love to play
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
Last night at the concert (Concert)
The audience, it flickers (Flickers)
They’re lighting up like Christmas
Still, that green’s not for me
On corners people cursing
To legalize their burning
But that ain’t no concern of mine
I keep doing me
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Don’t wanna get paranoid
Just wanna be making noise
You want a hit, it’s your choice
But please enjoy the show
[Chorus: Jack Met]
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s because I love to play
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
[Bridge: Ryan Met & Jack Met]
I’m not narcissistic
I’m just high off the music
And I don’t wanna miss it
But I wouldn’t stop you
I’m not narcissistic
You light up if you like it
And though I may not like it
You just keep doing you
(You just keep doing you, like)
[Interlude]
N-no grass today
N-no grass today
Keep-keep doing, keep doing me
Keep doing keep doing me
N-no grass today
Keep-keep doing, keep doing me
Keep doing, keep doing me
Keep-keep doing, keep doing me
Keep doing, keep doing me
N-no grass today
[Chorus: All]
I didn't smoke no grass today
But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s because I love to play
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
Three-Thirty=
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Never spoken with my mouth full
Yeah that's a mouthful and I'm doubtful
That I could get these lyrics out, oh
'Cause I think fast but I sing slow
If I ever started rapping
They'd be laughing, they won't believe me
But I got so much I wanna say
So I'm thinking rappers, they got it easy
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
Someone told me to be selfless
But we are helpless without attention
So if no one's paying attention
Then does my voice get to your headphones?
You start thinking 'bout the clock ticks
You get nervous, you start stressin'
So how am I supposed to fit this
In three minutes and thirty seconds
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Listen to my aching heart
Quick, before you skip the song
We are human after all
And we don't stay for long
[Verse 3: Jack Met]
Someone told me to be selfless
But we are helpless without attention
Wealthy people learn the lesson
And never donate without the press there
You wanna skip it if it's wordy
But fit the whole song in three-thirty
I thought I had the ADHD
But that's a real thing and I'm just lazy
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Listen to my aching heart
Quick, before you skip the song
We are human after all
And we don't stay for long
We are human after all
And we don't stay for long
[Interlude]
[Outro: Jack Met]
Listen to my aching heart
Will you keep this record on
If Ed Sheeran writes my song
I'll finally top the charts
If Ed Sheeran writes my song
I'll finally top the charts
Call My Dad=
[Verse 1: Ryan Met]
Oh my God, what's going on?
This night got fuckin' weird
Drove so fast my brain got buzzed
And now I'm standin' here
Met so many faces that
Will probably forget me
Boy, I bet I look so grown up
Shirt tucked in my jeans
[Chorus: Ryan Met]
And now after it all, I just really wanna call
My dad
My dad
I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
No, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
[Verse 2: Ryan Met]
We went dancing on the roof
And took some girls uptown
They started fighting with my friend
And I can't find him now
Hit some bars, and saw some brawls
And found a house to sleep
Forgot my retainer
Could you not be mad at me?
[Chorus: Ryan Met]
'Cause now, after it all, I'm just standing here to call
My dad
My dad
I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
No, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
[Outro: Ryan Met]
No, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
No, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
I'm Not Famous=
[Chorus]
Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
[Verse 1]
You've never heard of me
Or the weird shit I do and say
That's my favorite thing
That I'm not famous, no
And I'm never on TV
Throwing up on an LA street
Nobody judges me
'Cause I'm not famous, no
[Pre-Chorus]
Paparazzi is at an all time low
Paparazzi, they don't care where I go
[Chorus]
Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
[Verse 2]
You never overheard
That I blew twenty grand on shirts
Nobody knows my quirks
'Cause I'm not famous, no
Everyone got their habits
But you'll never hear what mine is
Best thing about my life is I'm not famous, no
[Pre-Chorus]
Paparazzi is at an all time low
Paparazzi, they don't care where I go
[Chorus]
Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
(Go!)
I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
[Hook]
Hate it, hate-hate it (no)
Hate it, hate- hate it
[Chorus]
Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
(No, no)
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
(I'm not, I'm not)
And I don't hate it, no
I'm not famous, no
(I'm not famous)
I'm not famous, no
(Go!)
I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
And I don't hate it, no
I'm not famous, no
Netflix Trip=
[Verse 1: Ryan Met]
I had my first crush in season two
She passed me notes and filled our hands with glue
And in my corduroys, we'd walk to school
I sat and crossed my legs like Jim would do
She moved away, I was on season three
It hit my heart so hard, I'd hardly speak
But I could find some peace and privacy
A paper company to sit with me
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?
[Verse 2: Ryan Met]
I turned down Jameson when I was twelve
I spent that Friday night with Steve Carell
The one where Dwight became the head of sales
My eighth-grade graduation wished me well
I lost my grandpa during season six
I watched my mom, she cried and held her kids
My mind was broken up, I couldn't think
So I just hugged her the way Michael did
[Chorus: Jack Met]
But who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?
[Bridge: Jack Met]
Wonder where we're going
Tell me who I am
Take in every moment
Hold it close again
[Verse 3: Ryan Met]
Now the finale's done and I'm alone
I'm on a Netflix trip here on my phone
But who I am is in these episodes
So don't you tell me that it's just a show
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Oh, who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?
[Outro: Jack Met]
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Bud Like You=
[Chorus]
Way up, way up, way up to the sky
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high
Way up, way up, way up to the moon
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you
[Verse 1]
Enough, enough, there's no celebrities here
So why's the bouncer taking everything so seriously?
It's you and I, it's cool you feel the same
Like why's the DJ here if he's just pressing play?
[Pre-Chorus]
Kickin' in the basement, kickin' in the basement
Hatin' all the same things too
If I need a pick me up, would you come and pick me up?
I could really use a bud like you
To pick me
[Chorus]
Way up, way up, way up to the sky
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high
Way up, way up, way up to the moon
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you
Way up, way up, way up to the sky
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high
Way up, way up, way up to the moon
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you
[Verse 2]
Enough, enough, there's no one here that we know
I think I knew a girl who knew the host, but she's heading home
We're standing, laughing at the disco ball
Like who'd invest in that when no one's looking at it?
[Pre-Chorus]
Kickin' in the basement, kickin' in the basement
Hatin' all the same things too
If I need a pick me up, would you come and pick me up?
I could really use a bud like you
To pick me
[Chorus]
Way up, way up, way up to the sky (Way up to the sky)
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high
Way up, way up, way up to the moon
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you
Way up, way up, way up to the sky
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high (Woah, and getting high)
Way up, way up, way up to the moon (Oh)
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you (Go!)
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you (Like you)
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you
[Bridge]
Boy, it's good to know (Bud like—)
Boy, it's good to know (I got a—)
Way up (Bud like—)
Way up to the moon
[Outro]
To pick me way up, way up, way up to the sky
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high
Way up, way up, way up to the moon
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you
Way up, way up, way up to the sky
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high (Woah, and getting high)
Way up, way up, way up to the moon
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you (Bud like you)
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you  (Go!)
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you
Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you
Come Hang Out=
[Intro: Samia Finnerty & Ryan Met, Jack Met]
Come, hang out 'cause you're out of your mind
You're working so damn hard, you forgot what you like
And come, hang out, don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
I can't complain, no, I won't be mourning
'Cause I skipped on prom for Elvis Duran in the Morning, yeah
All of my life I have been starving
Not for a dinner with friends, more of a starving artist
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Yep, yep, I'm gonna miss this someday (I'm gonna miss this someday)
Yep, yep, I missed another Friday
And all my friends say
[Chorus: Samia Finnerty & Ryan Met, Jack Met]
Come, hang out 'cause you're out of your mind
You're working so damn hard, you forgot what you like
And come, hang out, don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
Last album's sales could have been higher
Maybe that's why I haven't seen friends in a while
They're at a bar down in the Bahamas
While I'm doing promo, trying to blow up in Chicago
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Yep, yep, I'm gonna miss this someday (gonna miss this someday)
Yep, yep, I missed another Friday
And all my friends say
[Chorus: Samia Finnerty & Ryan Met, Jack Met, Samia Finnerty]
Come, hang out 'cause you're out of your mind
You're working so damn hard you forgot what you like
And come, hang out, don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time
Come, hang out 'cause you're out of your mind
You're working so damn hard, you forgot what you like
And come, hang out, don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time
Come, hang out 'cause you're missin' a lot
You haven't gone that far, you can find a real job (Find a real job)
And come, hang out, we can save you a shot
But I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time
(Next time, next time)
[Bridge: Jack Met]
Should I go for more clicks this year
Or should I follow the click in my ear?
Should I go for more clicks this year
Or should I follow the click in my ear?
Should I go for more clicks this year (Come, hang out)
Or should I follow the click in my ear? (Come, hang out)
Should I go for more clicks this year (Come, hang out)
Or should I follow the click in my ear? (Come, hang out; Click in my mind)
Go!
[Chorus: Samia Finnerty & Ryan Met, Jack Met]
Come, hang out 'cause you're out of your mind
You're working so damn hard you forgot what you like (Forgot what you like)
And come, hang out, don't you leave us behind
But I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time
But I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time
Come, hang out 'cause you're missing a lot
You haven't gone that far, you can find a real job (Find a real job)
And come, hang out, we can save you a shot
But I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time
[Outro: Jack Met]
I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time
I'll be there next time, I'll be there next time
Burn The House Down=
[Verse 1: Jack]
Used to keep it cool
Used to be a fool
All about the bounce in my step
Watch it on the news
Whatcha gonna do?
I could hit refresh and forget
Used to keep it cool
[Verse 2: Jack]
Should I keep it light?
Stay out of the fight?
No one’s gonna listen to me
If I write a song
Preaching what is wrong
Will they let me sing on TV?
Should I keep it light?
Is that right?
[Chorus]
Way up way up we go
Been up and down that road
Way up way up, oh no
We gon’ burn the whole house down
Watch me stand in the line
You’re only serving lies
You’ve got something to hide
We gon’ burn the whole house down
We gon’ burn the whole house down
[Verse 3: Jack]
Yeah, used to let it go
Walk into the show
Gawking at the tricks up your sleeve
Too good to be truth-
Full, I’m in a room
Full of entertainers and thieves
Used to let it go
Woah, oh no
(Woah, oh no)
[Chorus]
Way up way up we go
Been up and down that road
Way up way up, oh no
We gon’ burn the whole house down
Watch me stand in the line
You’re only serving lies
You’ve got something to hide
We gon’ burn the whole house down
We gon’ burn the whole house down
[Bridge: Jack]
(We gon’ burn the whole house down)
Should I hang my head low?
Should I bite my tongue?
Or should I march with every stranger from Twitter to get shit done?
Used to hang my head low
Now I hear it loud
Every stranger from Twitter is gonna burn this down
[Chorus]
Way up way up we go
Been up and down that road
Way up way up, oh no
We gon’ burn the whole house down
Watch me stand in the line (whoa oh)
You’re only serving lies (yeah)
You’ve got something to hide
We gon’ burn the whole house down
Woah oh, yeah
We gon’ burn the whole house down
We burn it down, we burn it down
We gon’ burn the whole house down
Role Models=
[Intro]
3, 4
[Chorus]
All my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
And, I will unravel if you rip away my best pieces
Would've never come so far without someone there to start it
Can I truly love the art, when I kinda hate the artist?
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
Wrong reasons
[Verse 1]
This time of year, I'm feelin' weird, might be allergies
Wanna move out, but when I move out, who'll be proud of me
Thought I was made, from men that were great, put that crown on me
Thought I was made, from Louis C.K
[Chorus]
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
And, I will unravel if you rip away my best pieces
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
Would've never come so far without someone there to start it
Can I truly love the art, when I kinda hate the artist?
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
Wrong reasons
[Verse 2]
I used to say, just what's on my brain, 'cause you always did
You used to be, so special to me, now you've taken it
Look at this mess, should I forget, what you gave to me?
Look at this mess, wake up Mr. West
[Chorus]
'Cause, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
And, I will unravel if you rip away my best pieces
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
Would've never come so far without someone there to start it
Can I truly love the art, when I kinda hate the artist?
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
Wrong reasons
[Outro]
Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah
Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah
Would've never come so far without someone there to start it
Can I truly love the art, when I kinda hate the artist?
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
Wrong reasons
Normal=
[Verse 1]
That was my favorite song, don't listen much anymore
My likeness isn't me, my likeness isn't at all, mm
[Chorus]
Is it normal to stand here and wish that I was back at home?
Is it normal to tell her I can't be normal anymore?
I don't know
So maybe I should go back home
[Verse 2]
I made a party song, so I'm in all of the dorms
I showed up once or twice, I think I'm missing the point, mm
[Chorus]
Is it normal to stand here, and wish that I was back at home?
Is it normal to tell her I can't be normal anymore?
I don't know
So maybe I should go back home
So maybe I should go back home
Maybe I should go back home
[Outro]
My friends have all new friends, I'm scared that they like 'em more
Pretender - Acoustic=
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
I'm a good pretender
Won't you come see my show?
I've got lots of problems
Well, good thing nobody knows
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Oh, I'm insecure, I'm insecure
I think I like what I'm supposed to
Like what I'm supposed to
I don't even mess with drugs
I do that 'cause you say it's dope to
You say it's dope to
[Chorus: AJR]
I'm a good pretender
I'm not really cool
I'm a good pretender
'Cause I'm just like you
I do not belong here
You all clearly do
But I'm a good pretender
So I'm just like
[Post-Chorus: AJR]
I'm a good pretender
I'm a good pretender
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
I'm a good pretender
All emotions in sync
Don't you think I'm clever
We laugh at all the same things
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Oh, I'm insecure, I'm insecure
I think I like what I'm supposed to
Like what I'm supposed to
I don't even mess with drugs
I do that 'cause you say it's dope to
You say it's dope to
[Chorus: AJR]
I'm a good pretender
I'm not really cool
I'm a good pretender
'Cause I'm just like you
I do not belong here
You all clearly do
But I'm a good pretender
So I'm just like
[Post-Chorus: AJR]
I'm a good pretender
I'm a good pretender
[Outro: Jack Met]
I'm just like you, do you like me too?
Now I'm just like you
I'm a good pretender
