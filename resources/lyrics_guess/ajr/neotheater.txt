Next Up Forever=
[Intro]
Your eyes are open, so never close them
You'll sail the ocean, finding where you should be
And if you're broken, you'll make your own thing
You'll make it so big for all the world to see
You'll make it so damn big for all the world to see
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
I'm kinda scared to drop this album
Let's push it back another week
I wanna be next up forever
Find a way to never hit my peak
I kinda wish I was still a virgin
Dying to finally see what sex is like
I wanna be next up forever
Forever, I'll be second in line
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Someday, they'll be talking about me
Right now, they're just walking around me
My God, are you growing without me?
Somebody, help me (Somebody, help me)
Someday, they'll be talking about me
Right now, they're just walking around me
My God, are you growing without me?
Somebody, help me (Somebody, help me)
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
This is my imagination
This is how it looks and sounds
But I gotta go so much bigger
So they can never shut me down
I'm kinda scared of graduation
'Cause who am I when this is done?
I wanna be next up forever
So the best is always yet to come
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Someday, they'll be talking about me
Right now, they're just walking around me
My God, are you growing without me?
Somebody, help me (Somebody, help me)
Someday, they'll be talking about me
Right now, they're just walking around me
My God, are you growing without me?
Somebody, help me (Somebody, help me)
[Bridge: Jack Met]
I gotta go so much bigger
So everybody’s proud of me
Welcome to the Neotheater
Won't everybody take their seats?
And I'll be next up forever
'Cause I don't know what's coming next
I know I gotta grow up sometime
But I don't think I'm ready yet
[Outro: Jack Met]
I know I gotta grow up sometime
But I'm not fucking ready yet
Your eyes are open, so never close them
You'll sail the ocean, finding where you should be
And if you're broken, you'll make your own thing
You'll make it so big for all the world to see
You'll make it so damn big for all the world to see
Birthday Party=
[Verse 1]
This hospital's got lots of cryin' kids
A minute ago, I did not exist
It's nice to finally meet my relatives
I bet it's always gonna stay this fun
I bet it's easy stayin' 'way from drugs
I bet our parents always stay in love
Always stay in love
[Pre-Chorus]
Me, my, oh, what a life
So me and all my people gon' be stepping in time (Wow)
Me, my, oh, what a life
So me and all my people gon' be stepping in time
[Chorus]
So thank you
For coming to my birthday party
I am one-minute-old today
And everything is going great (Oh)
Thank you
For coming to my birthday party
I am one-minute-old today
And my minute's been going great
And I hope it stays that way
[Verse 2]
I bet this Instagram's a load of fun
It's best to show the best of everyone
I bet it never bites us in the bum
I bet my ignorance is always bliss
Except ignoring pigment in our skin
I bet my country's nice to immigrants
And that's just how it is
[Pre-Chorus]
Me, my, oh, what a life
So me and all my people gon' be stepping in time (Wow)
Me, my, oh, what a life
So me and all my people gon' be stepping in time
[Chorus]
So thank you
For coming to my birthday party

And my minute's been going great
And I hope it stays that way
[Bridge]
In Heaven
Everything is fine
In Heaven
Everything is fine
You got your good things
And I've got
Heaven
Everything is fine
In Heaven
Everything is fine
You got your good things
I've got mine
[Chorus]
Thank you (Thank you)
For coming to my birthday party
I am one-minute-old today (One-minute-old today)
And everything is going great
(I've got mine)
Thank you (Thank you)
For coming to my birthday party
I am one-minute-old today (One-minute-old today)
And my minute's been going great
(I hope it stays that way)
[Outro]
This hospital's got lots of crying kids
A minute ago I did not exist
It's nice to finally meet my relatives
I bet I'll never outgrow all my friends
I bet I'll see a female president
Yeah, I can tell this life'll be a cinch
And that's just how it is
100 Bad Days=
[Verse 1]
Remember when we all got drunk?
I ended up with two broke thumbs
Oh my God, I felt so dumb, lucky me
I wrote a song that no one knows
I played a show and no one showed
Oh my God, I felt so alone, lucky me
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah) When all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
(Ah) What you gonna do? Who you gonna tell?
[Chorus]
Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
[Post-Chorus]
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
[Verse 2]
Remember when she broke my heart
Waitin' for the waiter to return my card?
Right as I let down my guard, lucky me
We had to work a bit more hard
Only just to get a little bit less far
We could laugh about it all tomorrow, couldn't we?
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah) When all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
(Ah) What you gonna do? Who you gonna tell?
[Chorus]
Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
[Post-Chorus]
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
[Bridge]
Screw your thing, it goes like this
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you
[Chorus]
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
Don't Throw Out My Legos=
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
My new address is hard to remember
So I wrote it on the back of my hand
'Cause I leave the nest this coming December
To make it as a grown man
I’m 'bout to lose my only defenders
I'm packing up whatever I can
[Pre-Chorus: All]
Been waiting for today, but
All I can think to say is
[Chorus: Jack Met with Ryan Met]
Oh no, don’t throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go?
What if I come back home, back home?
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go?
What if I come back home, back home?
[Post-Chorus: Jack Met]
Can we keep my Legos at home?
'Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
People want shirts with the band name on it
And suddenly, we ain't so bad
Saved up enough to rent an apartment
Far away from mom and dad
My Christmas card looks like a mugshot
'Cause suddenly I’m getting sad
[Pre-Chorus: All]
Been waiting for today, but
All I can think to say is
[Chorus: Jack Met with Ryan Met]
Oh no, don’t throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go?
What if I come back home, back home?
Oh no, don’t throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go?
What if I come back home, back home?
[Post-Chorus: Jack Met]
Can we keep my Legos at home?
'Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on
Can we keep my Legos at home?
’Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on
[Bridge: Jack Met]
It's cold out there, you're standing there
You're trying to face your greatest fear
You're shivering, you're trembling
It's warm in here, so come back in
[Chorus: Jack Met with Ryan Met]
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go?
What if I come back home, back home?
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go?
What if I come back home, back home?
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go?
What if I come back home, back home?
Oh no, I'll come by when I'm grown
It won't be the same though
I can't even go home, go home
[Outro: Jack Met]
Can we keep my Legos at home?
'Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on
Break My Face=
[Intro: Jack Met]
Okay!
Ah, ah, ah
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
You run your mouth, your tongue fell out
It's right there on the ground
But now, you'll never drown
You can't, you got no mouth
So it ain't all bad now
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
What doesn't kill you makes you ugly
Life gives you lemons
At least it gave you something
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Okay!
So if I break my face, and I don't look so great
My face is just my face (My face)
Okay!
So if I break my face, it ain't my darkest day
My face is just my face, I'm okay
[Post-Chorus: Jack Met]
Ah, ah, ah
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
You roll your eyes a hundred times
At every phony lie, are your eyes okay?
They rolled away, right down the interstate
But at least you can't cry today
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Okay!
So if I break my face, and I don’t look so great
My face is just my face
Okay!
So if I break my face, it ain’t my darkest day
My face is just my face, I’m okay
[Post-Chorus: Jack Met]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
[Bridge: Jack Met]
What doesn't kill you makes you ugly
Life gives you lemons
At least it gave you something
What doesn't kill you (What doesn't kill you)
Makes you ugly (Makes you ugly)
Life gives you lemons
At least it gave you something
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Okay!
So if I break my face, and I don't look so great
My face is just my face (My face)
'Cause everything is going great
So if I break my face, it ain't my darkest day
My face is just my face, I'm okay
[Outro: Jack Met]
Ah, ah, ah
I'm okay
At least it gave you something
Ah, ah, ah
At least it gave you something
Turning Out Pt. II=
[Verse 1: Ryan Met]
I am not chosen, or that unique
Honestly, you were and you chose me
Maybe I fucked up everything
Is this how it feels to be blue?
You said you'd love me, no matter what
You said you'd love me, is that what I loved?
All of these choices messed me up
And everyone's mean, except you
[Chorus: Ryan Met]
I think I probably wasn't in love with you
I think I probably loved the idea of you
And though I may be missing the feel of you
I think I probably wasn't in love with you
I said it 'cause I no longer wanna hurt
I said it back to you 'cause you said it first
And though I may be wishing it wasn't true
I think I probably wasn't in love
I wasn’t in love with you
[Verse 2: Ryan Met]
I was too worried how we'd end up
I wasn't looking and you grew up
Now I'm here writing this dumb song
'Cause I can't even tell you the truth
[Chorus: Ryan Met]
I think I probably wasn't in love with you
I think I probably loved the idea of you
And though I may be missing the feel of you
I think I probably wasn't in love with you
I said it 'cause I no longer wanna hurt
I said it back to you 'cause you said it first
And though I may be wishing it wasn't true
I think I probably wasn't in love
I wasn't in love with you
[Outro: Ryan Met]
This is gonna break your heart
I'm so sorry, yeah, I know
This is gonna break your heart
Is this all that life's about?
Trying to love how you turn out?
I don't love it much at all
This is gonna break your heart
I'm so sorry, yeah, I know
This is gonna break your heart
Is this all that life's about?
Trying to love how you turn out?
I don't love it much at all
I don't love it much at all
The Entertainment's Here=
[Chorus: Jack Met]
But oh my, oh my God
The entertainment's here
Everything is suddenly amazing here
Sit back, man
Relax, man
Sit back, man
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
I used to be distracted by my favorite song
I loved it very much, I made the song my alarm
And now I kind of hate hearing it every morn
Don’t wake up anymore, I don't wanna be bored
I used to be distracted, rolling 'round in the dirt
But recently, I’m thinking 'bout my purpose on Earth
But I don't wanna think about my purpose no more
Because it may come up short
Man, I hate being bored
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
I've been thinking
That too much thinking
Can start me sinking down
[Chorus: Jack Met]
But oh my, oh my God
The entertainment's here
Everything is suddenly amazing here
Sit back, man
Relax, man
Sit back, man
Don't make plans
'Cause oh my, oh my God
The entertainment's here
You don’t even gotta use your brain from here
Just sit back, man
Relax, man
Sit back, man
Come on, then
[Post-Chorus]
The entertainment’s here
The entertainment's here
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
I used to be distracted by my burgers and shakes
I’m running out of things that I can do with my day
'Cause I can only eat so many times in a day
Until I'm bored again and I'm stuck in my brain
You wonder what they did before inventing the phone
Yeah, how could anybody face the quiet alone?
I’d rather be in Vegas than my very own home
Yeah, my cash'll be gone, but my mind'll be blown
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
I've been thinking
That too much thinking
Can start me sinking down
[Chorus: Jack Met]
But oh my, oh my God
The entertainment's here
Everything is suddenly amazing here
Sit back, man
Relax, man
Sit back, man
Don't make plans
'Cause oh my, oh my God
The entertainment's here
You don't even gotta use your brain from here
Just sit back, man
Relax, man
Sit back, man
Come on, then
[Post-Chorus]
The entertainment's here
The entertainment's here
The entertainment's here
The entertainment's here
Yep, yep, yep, yep
The entertainment's here
Yep, yep, yep, yep
Karma=
[Chorus: Jack Met]
I've been so good
I've been helpful and friendly
I've been so good
Why am I feeling empty?
I've been so good
I've been so good this year
I've been so good
But it's still getting harder
I've been so good
Where the hell is the karma?
I've been so good
I've been so good this year
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Why are you asking me why?
My days and nights are filled with disappointment
Fine, oh, no, everything's fine
I'm not sure why I booked today's appointment
[Chorus: Jack Met]
I've been so good
I've been helpful and friendly
I've been so good
Why am I feeling empty?
I've been so good
I've been so good this year
And I've been so good
But it's still getting harder
I've been so good
Where the hell is the karma?
I've been so good
I've been so good this year
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
What? Am I normal or not?
Am I crazier than other patients?
Right, I've done everything right
So where's the karma, Doc? I've lost my patience
[Chorus: Jack Met]
'Cause I've been so good
I've been working my ass off
I've been so good
Still, I'm lonely and stressed out
I've been so good
I've been so good this year
And I've been so good
But it's still getting harder
I've been so good
Where the hell is the karma?
I've been so good
I've been so good this year
[Bridge: Jack Met]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
I've been so good this year
I've been so good this year
[Outro: Jack Met]
Time, I know we're out of time
But what if sad thoughts come and I can't stop it?
Bye, I don't wanna say bye
If only I could keep you in my pocket
To give me some diagnosis of why I'm so hollow
Please give me instructions, I promise I'll follow
I tripped on my ankle and fractured my elbow
But doesn't that mean that the tour's gonna sell, though?
I try to explain the good faith that's been wasted
But after an hour, it sounds like complaining
Wait, don't go away, can I lie here forever?
You say that I'm better, why don't I feel better?
The universe works in mysterious ways
But I'm starting to think it ain't working for me
Doctor, should I be good, should I be good this year?
Beats=
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Okay, people laugh at my jokes now
Yeah, it’s so strange to have a bit of success
Now our song plays in the produce aisle
What if some day, you say, "Who the hell is that?"
Okay, this all could be over by the next day
So should I make famous friends?
Now our song plays in the produce aisle
What if some day you say, "Who the hell is that?"
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Would Beats by Dre pay 20K
For us to say that they are great?
Recording costs for this whole song
Could all be paid by Beats by Dre
Would Beats by Dre pay 20K
For us to say that they are great?
Recording costs for this whole song
Could all be paid by Beats by Dre
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
Oh, my demographic will click on anything graphic
Now I’m in fashion, I don’t know how long it’s lasting
It could be passing, should I put eggs in more baskets
And try out fashion before I go out of fashion?
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Would Beats by Dre pay 20K
For us to say that they are great?
Recording costs for this whole song
Could all be paid by Beats by Dre
Would Beats by Dre pay 20K
For us to say that they are great?
Recording costs for this whole song
Could all be paid by Beats by Dre
[Bridge: Samia]
What can you do?
Don't be a fool
What can you do?
Don't be a fool
What can you do?
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Would Beats by Dre pay 20K
For us to say that they are great?
Recording costs for this whole song
Could all be paid by Beats by Dre
Would Beats by Dre pay 20K
For us to say that they are great?
Recording costs for this whole song
Could all be paid by Beats by Dre
[Outro: Jack Met]
Would Beats by Dre pay 20K
For us to say that they are great?
And every star that I used to mock
Was probably paid, am I the same?
Wow, I'm Not Crazy=
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Frankly, I’m scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk, it’s like, "Wow, I’m not crazy"
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Don’t kill me 'cause I’m just the messenger
I already went and took my temperature
And I’m not sick, I took all my vitamins
Yeah, I’m not sick, I’m just kinda different
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Oh, different, so different
They tell us to be different
But no one told me I could go too far
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
[Chorus: All]
Frankly, I’m scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk, it’s like, "Wow, I’m not crazy"
Frankly, I feel insane
But you say you feel the same
And suddenly, it’s like, "Hey, I’m not crazy"
'Cause when you talk, it’s like, Wow, I’m not crazy"
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
Don’t kill me 'cause I’m just the messenger
I’ve never seen someone quite this strange before
You’re just like me, you took all your vitamins
You’re just like me and you take delight in it
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Oh, different, so different
They tell us to be different
But no one told me I could go too far
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
[Chorus: All]
Frankly, I’m scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk, it’s like, "Wow, I’m not crazy"
Frankly, I feel insane
But you say you feel the same
And suddenly, it’s like, "Hey, I’m not crazy"
'Cause when you talk, it’s like, Wow, I’m not crazy"
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
[Bridge: Jack Met]
When you talk, it’s like, "Wow"
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
When you talk, it’s like, "Wow"
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
When you talk, it’s like, "Wow"
When you talk, it’s like, "Wow"
When you talk, it’s like, "Wow"
Yeah, when you talk, it’s like, "Wow"
[Outro: All]
Frankly, I’m scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk, it’s like, "Wow, I’m not crazy"
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
Dear Winter=
[Verse 1]
Dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I hope they don't make fun of you
When you grow up and go to school, okay?
'Cause Winter is a badass name
Dear Winter, I hope you talk to girls
Or boys or anyone you like
I just hope you don't stay in every night
'Cause I wish I was out tonight
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
It really doesn't seem like there's anyone for me
But dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I'm hoping that some day, I can meet you on this Earth
But shit, I gotta meet your mom first
[Verse 2]
Dear Winter, I hope you like this song
And even when you're 13
And you scream at me for parenting you wrong
I hope it's still a badass song
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
It really doesn't seem like there's anyone for me
But dear Winter, I hope you like your name
You know I cannot wait to teach you how to curse
But shit, I gotta meet your mom first
[Verse 3]
Dear Winter, don't move too far away
And please don't say I'm hovering
When I text you to ask about your day
I wanna hear about your day
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Will we still hang out and talk when I'm no longer in charge?
Oh, dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I hope you let me take a shot with you on your 21st
But shit, you gotta ask your mom first
[Outro]
Dear Winter, I'm looking for your mom
I gotta find a girl that doesn't mind that I'm inside my head a lot
Winter, it won't be too long
First, I just gotta find your mom

Let me catch my breath
Let me catch my
I can't remember how I got here, got here
[Outro: Jack Met]
They wanted heaven from me
I gave 'em hell
Now they want something bigger
I'm overwhelmed
I think it's time to go now
I think my curtain's falling
Just don't forget about me
When you get out of college
If it's my final album
And if I am forgotten
I hope I made you smile
That's all I ever wanted
Congratulations on your bit of success
