Overture=
[Intro]
These are our drums
This is our melody
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Now listen closely as our drums become our melody
And here's our song
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
[Verse 1]
So let me play my violin for you (Bang, bang, bang)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
So let me play my violin for you
The truth is that I'm screwed
Still, Joe, do you think I'm cool?
[Verse 2]
(One, two, one-one, two, three, four)
(One, two, one-one, two, three, four)
I got friends in a lot of weird places (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Wonder if they're gonna call, depending what my face is (Two, three, four)
I got friends in a lot of weird places (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Wonder if they're gonna call, depending what my facе is
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yеah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
[Verse 3]
Humpty Dumpty when, Humpty Dumpty when
Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one's around"
Humpty Dumpty when, Humpty Dumpty when
Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one, when no one
When no one's around, around, around, around"
[Interlude]
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
And I'll scream when no one, when no one, when no one's around
[Verse 4]
One day, maybe someday, I'll be so out of touch
I'll become a trumpet or a drum set in a sad orchestra
One day, maybe someday in a world speeding up
It's getting hard, so very hard to keep up
One day, maybe someday, I'll be so out of touch
I'll become a trumpet or a drum set
In a sad orchestra
One day, I won't know what to write
And I can't be eighteen my whole life
But I'm too fuckin' young to feel so fuckin' old
But I'll try and I'll try and I'll try
But I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright
[Outro]
Bang, bang, bang
But I'm way less sad
Adventure is out there
But you gotta be some—
Come on, guy
Bang, bang, bang
But it's all I have
Oh, I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright
Infinity=
[Verse 1: Jack]
Was it all in my head?
In an empty bed
And I told you that I need you
Baby, can't you see I'm alone?
Oh, oh
I was lost in my feet
On an empty street
So I save your seat, infinity
Forever figures 5 and 3
You know, oh oh
[Pre-Chorus 1: Ryan]
Cross my heart and hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
My mama says to pick the best
And you are it
[Chorus: Jack]
Hey!
All our trouble's gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Here we are again like we should've been
Oh my lady, can I have this dance?
My lady
Hey!
All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
[Verse 2: Adam]
Was it hard to believe?
Wear your heart on my sleeve
And I'll hold you when you're lonely
When you're cold cause you're the only girl for me
[Pre-Chorus 2: Ryan]
Cross my heart and hope to die
Since you came into my life
My mama says to pick the best
And you are it
[Chorus: Jack]
Hey
All our trouble's gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Here we are again like we should've been
Oh my lady can I have this dance?

All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
[Chorus]
Oh, Hey

Here we are again, like we should've been
Oh my lady, can I have this dance?
Hey
All our trouble's gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
Here we are again, like we should've been
Oh my lady, can I have this dance?
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Hey
All our troubles gone
Like when we were young
Take me back to where we all began
[Outro: All]
Cross my heart and hope to die
Since you came into my life
My mama says to pick the best
And you are it

[Intro]
I'm ready...
[Verse 1: Jack Met & Ryan Met]
You're feeling good, you're feeling right
Across the floor, and I'm already losing my mind
Baby girl, looking fine
Watch you playing and playing and playing these guys
Catch my stare, little smile
Tell me that you're ready and you're feeling the vibe
Someday I'll be so damn sublime
We'll arrive behind a hashtag sign
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
I won't forget you, but I may
Forget your name
[Chorus: AJR]
My lady
I know what you're thinking
When the bass starts ringing
Can you tell me when you're stoked to start?
Are you ready for tonight, setting it on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark
My lady, I know what you're thinking
When the bass starts ringing
Can you tell me when you're stoked to start?
Are you ready for tonight, setting it on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark
[Post-Chorus: AJR]
Are you ready?
I'm ready...

Watch me dear, and say what you wanna know (Say what you wanna know)
Beauty lies, within the eyes
Of the beholder, I'll be holding you close all night
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
I won't forget you, but I may
Forget your name
[Chorus: AJR]
My lady
I know what you're thinking
When the bass starts ringing
Can you tell me when you're stoked to start?
Are you ready for tonight, setting it on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark
My lady, I know what you're thinking
When the bass starts ringing
Can you tell me when you're stoked to start?
Are you ready for tonight, setting it on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark

Break me down, I'm ready, break me down
Are you ready?
My Calling=
[Verse 1]
Oh father, father, I'm a dreamer (a dreamer)
We dream of green, but now we're gray
Up on a hill, down by the river
That river took my girl away
[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder, is something in the water make me wanting more?
Make me wanting more
A heartbreak and a hundred red balloons
Now I'm off the floor
So here I go
[Chorus]
I'm coming up, it might be my calling, my calling
I'm coming up, it might be my time

I'll send a postcard from the sky
[Post-Chorus]
My calling, my calling
My calling, my calling
[Verse 2]
Oh, Cleopatra was a lover
But this world of mine is turning green
I'm sailing by the clouds above her

Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
[Verse 1]
I'm up and I raise my cup, singing everything is gold
Crew neck and a white blank check

I walked on sippin' on that love
It's another bumpy road
But I'm up and I raise my cup and I wanna take her home

Don't got a lot to say
Girl on fire

We are young

Perfume in a hotel room
We go bouncin' back for more (Yo-del-lay ho)
Oh, I love sippin' on that fun
It's a feeling we adore
But I'm up and I raise my cup and I wanna take her home
(Yo-del-lay ho)

I run my mouth
Don't got a lot to say
Girl on fire
Could burn my heart away
We are young
But we can make it rain

Pitchfork Kids=
[Verse 1]
I didn't know her, couldn't hold her
Bones didn't settle in
She's gotta have it, gotta have it
Oh, with her hipster friends
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, she's the rough and the rowdiest kid
Oh oh, and there's more where she lives
[Chorus]
And why should I spend time running for my life?
And when the skies are open, we'll still be singing this
I know they're coming for me, we're not the pitchfork kids
Oh oh, it's the loneliest life that we live
Oh oh, we're not running with the pitchfork kids
[Verse 2]
The moon is upon us, gaining on us
She's crossed there, to stay
We had to part, couldn't break her heart 'cause their blood pumps through her veins
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, she's the rough and the rowdiest kid
Oh oh, and there's more where she lives
[Chorus]
And why should I spend time running for my life?
And when the skies are open, we'll still be singing this
I know they're coming for me, we're not the pitchfork kids
Oh oh, it's the loneliest life that we live
Oh oh, we're not running with the pitchfork kids
[Outro]
And why should I spend time running for my life?
It's the loneliest life that we live
We're not running with the pitchfork kids
And when the skies are open, we'll still be singing this
I know they're coming for me, we're not the pitchfork kids
Oh oh, it's the loneliest life that we live
Oh oh, we're not running with the pitchfork kids
Woody Allen=
[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Hey! Hey!
[Chorus: Jack]
Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen
Finally, I'm right where I should be
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot
You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops
You know
Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen
Oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1: Ryan]
Called you up so we could reminisce
About the old days, gold days, how we've been
The city's rusty after what we did
We did, we did, we did
[Pre-Chorus: All]
Hey, and though I know it's been a long time in the records
But I saw you smiling like dynamite in the record store
And now I'm shaking (shaking), waiting (waiting)
As you come say hello (hello, hello, hello, hello)
[Chorus: Jack]
Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen
Finally I'm right where I should be
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot
You hit the station go insane and when the kick-drum drops
You know now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen
Oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2: Ryan]
Every time I get the urge to go
I'm the king of the island on a rusty throne
Who the fuck wants to rule, ruling all alone, alone, alone, alone
[Pre-Chorus:All]
Hey and though I know it's been a long time in the records
But I saw you smiling like dynamite in the record store
And now I'm hoping (hoping), wishing (wishing)
As I walk you to your door (your door, your door, your door, your door)
[Chorus: Jack]
Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen
Finally I'm right where I should be
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot
You hit the station go insane and when the kick-drum drops
You know now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen
Oh-oh-oh
[Bridge: Adam]
And when the weekend comes around
Make our way through rusty towns
Lift the weight up off your back
You're with me love, just relax
[Chorus: Jack]
Now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen
Finally I'm right where I should be
Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot
You hit the station go insane and when the kick-drum drops
You know now I'm feeling just like Woody Allen
Oh-oh-oh
Livin' on Love=
[Intro]
Now we're livin' on love
[Verse 1]
You said marriage has a nice ring to it
And my jaw dropped down like the kick drum knew it
I can't stop and let you go
Baby, I gotta mind to let you know
I'm not one to take it fast
I got the best seat back in history class
One last chance to make it real
Baby, I wanna tell you how I feel
[Pre-Chorus]
Sayin' you
You make me feel so brand new
What can I do?
[Chorus]
Let's toast the ones who got away
Three cheers for what we didn't say
Well, if it matters
Here's some flowers
'Cause we're livin' on love
Let's drink to everything we got
Let's dance for everything we're not
And for the wackos
And the assholes
Now we're livin' on love
Livin' on love, livin' on love, livin' on love
Livin' on love, livin' on love, livin' on love
Now we're livin' on love
[Post-Chorus]
Oh—(hey), oh—(hey), oh—
Now we're livin' on love
[Verse 2]
We'll be found in Frankie's town
And tell the world we're gonna shake the ground
One last chance to make it real
Baby, I wanna tell you how I feel
[Pre-Chorus]
Sayin' you
You make me feel so brand new
What can I do?
[Chorus]
Let's toast the ones who got away
Three cheers for what we didn't say
Well, if it matters
Here's some flowers
'Cause we're livin' on love
Let's drink to everything we got
Let's dance for everything we're not
And for the wackos
And the assholes
Now we're livin' on love
Livin' on love, livin' on love
Livin' on love, livin' on love
Livin' on love, livin' on love
Now we're livin' on love
[Post-Chorus]

Oh—(hey), oh—(hey), oh—
Now we're livin' on love
[Bridge]
Hey, you're the one I wait for
Wait each and every day for
You (you!), you (you!), baby
That rhythm all around us
Sweet love, it finally found us
You, baby girl, oh–
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, oh!
Oh—(hey), oh—(hey), oh—
Now we're livin' on love
Oh—(hey), oh—(hey), oh—
Now we're livin' on love
Big White Bed=

All I want is you, my dear
We will live up on the tree
In a big white house, in a big white bed
Darling, this is not the end
[Chorus, harmonies]
[Verse]
All I want is you, my dear
We will live up on the tree
In a big white house, in a big white bed
Darling, this is not the end
[Chorus, harmonies]
[Bridge]
Watching clouds overhead
Here she lies in her bed
There's a long day ahead
She is lost in her bed
Watching clouds overhead
Here she lies in her bed
There's a long day ahead
She is lost in her bed
[Chorus, harmonies]
[Outro]
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
The World Is a Marble Heart=
[Verse 1]
The world is a marble heart
Too fragile, too broken
Left without nothing but our bags to hold on to
Yeah out in the daylight
And out of the jungle
We could have been, we should have been
What your heart couldn't handle
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like I need, to forget you
Run away girl, 'cause I let you
Now you found some other man, you see
I'm better off without you, 'cause the man ain't me!
[Chorus]
(My oh my) I'm going right now
(Right all right) To the beginning
(Why oh why) What you denied from the start
(My oh my) And now you can't go breaking my heart, yeah
(Right all right) Woah-waa-ooh
(Why oh why) And now you can't go breaking my heart
[Verse 2]
The world is a marble heart;
It's bullshit and we know it
Like a flower sheltered in stone
With no chance of re-growing
Like push comes to shove
Like I'm out on your doorstep
We could have been, we should have been
With only my soul left
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like I need (woah), to forget you
Run away girl, 'cause I let you
Now you found some other man, you see
I'm better off without you, 'cause the man ain't me!
[Chorus]
(My oh my) I'm going right now
(Right all right) To the beginning
(Why oh why) What you denied from the start
(My oh my) And now you can't go breaking my heart, yeah
(Right all right) Woah- waa -ooh
(Why oh why) And now you can't go breaking my heart
[Turntablism]
(H-heart h-heart)
Now you can't go breaking my heart (h-heart h-heart)
Now you can't go breaking my heart, ooh
(Bre-bre-bre) breaking my heart
And now you, now you can't go breaking
Now you can't go breaking my heart
[Bridge]
Feel like I need, to forget you
Run away girl, 'cause I let you
Now you found some other man, you see
Now you found some other man, you see
I'm better off without you, 'cause the man ain't...
[Chorus]
Now you can't go breaking my heart
(My oh my) I'm going back now
(Right all right) To the beginning
(Why oh why) What you denied from the start
(My oh my) And now you can't go breaking my heart, yeah
(Right all right) Woah
(Why oh why) And now you can't go breaking my heart
The Green and the Town=
[Verse 1]
A year from now, we won't be pretty
A year from now, we won't be young
But we will live among the giants
Before the giants learn to run
[Bridge]
Now we are the blessed
Now we are the strong
Take my hand, and let me know
That it feels good
To feel at home
[Verse 2]
We would sail across the ocean
If cloudy skies should take our friends
And we will learn from the giants
Before the giants learn from them
[Bridge]
Now we are the blessed
Now we are the strong
Take my hand, and let me know
That it feels good
To feel at home
[Chorus]
What can I say
Without a say?
We've got a way to go
And what can I do
To get back to you
And help us to find a home
To search the Green and Town
[Verse 3]
A year from now
We won't be lovers
We'll just be suits and ties and shoes
And we will grow without our parents
Cause soon we will be giants too
[Bridge]
Now we are the blessed
Now we are the strong
Take my hand, and let me know
That it feels good
To feel at home
[Chorus]
What can I say
Without a say?
We've got a way to go
And what can I do
To get back to you
And help us to find a home
To search the Green and Town
[Outro]
I will search the green
And I will search the town
But I will never
Find a one like you
I will search the green
And I will search the town
But I will never
Find a one like you
I will search the green
And I will search the town
But I will never
Find a one like you
I will search the green
And I will search the town
But I will never
Find a one like you
I will search the green
And I will search the town
But I will never
Find a one like you
I will search the green
And I will search the town
But I will never
Find a one like you
I will search the green
And I will search the town
But I will never
Find a one like you
Big Idea=
[Intro]
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
[Verse 1: Ryan]
I've seen almost every side of the industry
Except the side we've been working seven years to see
Just some kids with pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
(But no IDs)
So bar scenes weren't an option
Ukulele DJs, only band in the genre
And we're dreaming of Bahamas
So pass around the bottle
Good music's still good even if no one is watching
[Chorus: Jack]
Now you're on top of the world tonight
You can do anything you'd like
And through that struggle, we made a start
You can do anything you want
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Tryna stick it to the man before we're grown
And through that struggle, we made a start
You can do anything you want
[Post-Chorus]
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
[Verse 2: Ryan,  Adam]
John's too big to fail
Make it superstar
His label's doing the thing, and we were doing ours
Champagne at the discotheque
I was feeling kind of alone 'till I heard that track
Go!
And now we celebrate
If only for today
No story's a fairytale
I don't know if we'll make it
But we're not too big to fail
[Chorus: Jack]
Now you're on top of the world tonight
You can do anything you'd like
And through that struggle, we made a start
You can do anything you want
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Tryna stick it to the man before we're grown
And through that struggle, we made a start
You can do anything you want
[Bridge: Adam]
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Tryna stick it to the man before we're grown
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Tryna stick it to the man before we're grown
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
Pro tools, and a mic, and a big idea
[Chorus: Jack]
Oh oh
Now you're on top of the world tonight
You can do anything you'd like
And through that struggle, we made a start
You can do anything you want
And we're just children in a world of diversion
Tryna stick it to the man before we're grown
And through that struggle, we made a start
You can do anything you want
[Outro]
You can do anything you want
Growing Old on Bleecker Street=
[Verse 1: Ryan]
No point in dreaming if you’re alone
No point in walking without the road
No point in crying without that someone there beside you
Saying, "It will be okay"
[Pre-Chorus: Ryan]
I'll take my time
I'll take my time
You cannot rush
What can’t be timed
And it's tough believing
There's someone living out there
Happier than me
Happier than me
[Chorus: Jack]
We may be lost, and gone forever
The rain will wash our memory
But when we cry, we cry together
Like it was meant to be
[Verse 2: Adam]
I woke up last night from a dream
That we'd grow old on Bleecker Street
Sit by the fire and I'd play my guitar
But dreams are only dreams
[Verse 3: Ryan]
And then I wonder when we leave
Will the moon still be white
And the river green
Sometimes I wonder if we matter at all
If we're not written down
Who will remember now?
[Chorus: Jack]
We may be lost, and gone forever
The rain will wash our memory
But when we cry, we cry together
Like it was meant to be
[Outro]
We may be lost, and gone forever
The rain will wash our memory
But when we cry, we cry together
Like it was meant to be
