Maybe Man=
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Wish I was a stone so I couldn't feel
You'd yell in my face, it'd be no big deal
But I'd miss the way we make up and smile
Don't wanna be stone, I changed my mind
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
I wish I had eyes in the back of my head
Then I could see the places I've been
But then I would know that you're talkin' shit
I don't wanna know what my friends think
[Verse 3: Jack Met]
Wish I were my dog out on the lawn
I'd be so glad when I hear you come home
But if I were my dog, I wouldn't live long
I'm sure gonna miss her when she's gone
[Verse 4: Jack Met]
I wish I could act in a show on TV
'Cause then I could practice not bein' me
I'll practice my cry, put it into my reel
But you won't believe me when I cry for real
[Verse 5: Jack Met]
I wish that my brain would triple in size
I'd nail every joke, I'd win every fight
But I'd get too deep with that kind of mind
I don't wanna know the point of life
[Verse 6: Jack Met]
In some other life, I would be rich
I'd travel in style, I'd cover the bill
But couldn't complain 'bout anything small
Nobody'd feel bad for me at all
[Verse 7: Jack Met]
If I was cocaine or a bottle of Jack
I'd get invited to every frat
But when you get old and your good days are passed
You'll only want me when you're sad
[Verse 8: Jack Met]
Wish I was a song, your favorite one
You'd follow the dance to me at your prom
I would be there when your baby is born
For two or three minutes, then I'm gone
[Verse 9: Jack Met]
I wish I was big, as big as my house
I'd sleep on the trees, I'd skip every crowd
But I wouldn't fit on my therapist's couch
God, I could really use him now
[Verse 10: Jack Met]
I wish I was God, I'd never trip up
And if I did, well, so fuckin' what?
I could be cruel and break all your stuff
Yeah, I'd be loved no matter what
[Verse 11: Jack Met]
But if I was God, it'd get kinda weird
'Cause you would only say what I wanna hear
And then you would die, you'd love me to death
I'd never know who the hell I am
[Verse 12: Jack Met]
I wish I was me, whoever that is
I could just be and not give a shit
Hey, I'll be whatever makes you a fan
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am
[Outro: Jack Met & Rob Piccione]
One, two, pandemonium
One, two, pandemonium
Here I go again
One, two, pandemonium
Here I go again
One, two, pandemonium
One, two
Here I go again
Touchy Feely Fool=
[Verse 1]
Well, I'm not too superstitious
But I knock on wood a lot
Prayin' I wake up tomorrow
And get the guts to tell you off
But I know I'll never get there
You could scream you wish me dead
But I'll crawl back to you tomorrow
Why the hell can't I get mad?
[Pre-Chorus]
Someday, won't this be funny?
Well, I want it funny now
Man, I wanna laugh so loud
Someday, won't this be long ago?
I wanna feel that now
Sorry if I can't see how
[Chorus]
I'm screwed
But, hey, what can you do?
I'm a touchy feely fool
I would give anything to not give a shit about you
Life is pretty cruel
For a touchy feely fool
I would give anything to not give a shit, but I do
I would give anything to not give a shit
[Verse 2]
Well, I'm not too claustrophobic
But I lose my breath sometimes
Now I can't even talk to ya
Now your lawyers talk to minе
Could you teach me to be ruthlеss?
Could I be unfeeling too?
Maybe someday when I'm older
I'll be better off like you
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm better off a stick, I'm better off a stone
I'm better off a jerk, I'm better off alone
I'm better not feeling stress or feeling bliss
I won't feel much, at least I won't be feelin' this
[Chorus]
I'm screwed
But, hey, what can you do?
I'm a touchy feely fool
I would give anything to not give a shit about you
Life is pretty cruel
For a touchy feely fool
I would give anything to not give a shit, but I do (I do, I do)
I would give anything to not give a shit
[Bridge]
But someday, won't this be funny?
Well, I want it funny now
Man, I wanna laugh so loud
Someday, won't this be long ago?
I wanna feel that now
I'm sorry if I can't see how
[Outro]
Someday, someday, someday
Yes I'm A Mess=
[Verse 1]
I leave my house at three o'clock
With two hundred texts and two missed calls
Guess all of the friends that I pissed off
All talked
And I took a job for just July
But feels like I might be here for life
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I’m in it now, I'm in it now
Could I start again somehow?
[Chorus]
Yes, I'm a mess with an S on my chest
Got stress fillin’ up my head
So I spent last night blowin' up my life
Now you won't see me again
Cheers to the front and cheers to the back
And cheers to the 2010s
I could hate my guts when the sun comes up
But I like myself like this
I like myself like this
[Verse 2]
Why should I fix the shit I've done
When I could just pack my shit and run?
Delete every number from my phone
So long
Yeah, I'll get new shirts 'cause mine all stink
And I'll tell my boss what I really think
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm in it now, I’m in it now
Could I start again somehow?
[Chorus]
Yes, I’m a mess with an S on my chest
Got stress fillin' up my head
So I spent last night blowin’ up my life
Now you won't see me again
Cheers to the front and cheers to the back
And cheers to the 2010s
I could hate my guts when the sun comes up
But I like myself like this
I like myself like this
[Bridge]
Yes, I'm a mess with an S on my chest
So I spent last night blowin' up my life
Now you won’t see me again
Yes, I'm a mess with an S on my chest
I could hate my guts when the sun comes up
But I guess that's what this is
I like myself like this
[Outro]
I could hate my guts when the sun comes up
But I like myself like this
The Dumb Song=
[Intro]
(Okay, okay)
Oh, in my head
[Verse 1]
You said with certainty
I may be the dumbest person that you've ever seen
You think you're hurtin' me
Bet you won't believe it, but you kinda set me free
[Verse 2]
You've mentioned Adderall
Slip this guy a sedative, he's bouncin' off the wall
Honey, it's no big deal
We'll get you back to college, you could study somethin' real
[Pre-Chorus]
So if that's how you feel
[Chorus]
When we go down
When kingdom come
Don't look at me, don't look at me
I'm just too dumb
I'd love to stay (Love to stay)
But like you said (Like you said)
Don't look at me (Nothin' in my head)
'Cause I got nothin' in my head
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, in my head
[Verse 3]
Too dumb for breakin' up
I'd do it in person, but I'd probably mess it up
I'll text you, "That's enough"
That's how empty-headed people get through shitty stuff
[Verse 4]
Your world is endin' soon
Mine's a little better 'cause I never watch the news
You make my lunch today
I would do it, but I couldn't work my microwave
[Pre-Chorus]
So if that's what you're sayin'
[Chorus]
When we go down
When kingdom come
Don't look at me, don't look at me
I'm just too dumb
I'd love to stay (Love to stay)
But like you said (Like you said)
Don't look at me (Nothin' in my head)
'Cause I got nothin' in my head
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, in my head
[Bridge]
You should not have done that
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da)
(Da-da da-da-da da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da)
(Da-da da-da-da da-da-da-da)
[Chorus]
When we go down (We go down)
When kingdom come (Kingdom come)
Don't look at me, don't look at me (Much too dumb)
I'm much too dumb
I'd love to stay (Love to stay)
But like you said (Like you said)
Don't look at me (Nothin' in my head)
'Cause I got nothin' in my head
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, in my head
Oh, in my head
[Outro]
When we go down
When kingdom come
Don't look at me, don't look at me
I'm just too dumb
Inertia=
[Verse 1]
(Inertia)
I've worn the same skinny jeans
Since I was fifteen
It's probably nothing
(Inertia)
My friends say they're quittin' this week
To chase down their dreams
They're probably bluffin' but
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you like it bigger, better, but you do what you can? (Do what you can)
Don't you like a little better when you don't understand? (Don't understand)
I was gonna save the planet, but today I got plans
I guess this is just what I am
[Chorus]
I'm an object in motion, I've lost all emotion
My two legs are broken, but look at me dance
An object in motion, don't ask where I'm going
'Cause whеre I am goin' is right where I am (Oh, man)
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Whеre I am goin' is right where I am
[Verse 2]
(Inertia)
You said you'd break up with her
But she met your family
And dating's the worst, yeah
(Inertia)
Now, you're not in love anymore
But you'll stick it out
For, like, twenty years more, sayin', oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you like it bigger, better, but you do what you can? (Do what you can)
Don't you like a little better when you don't understand? (Don't understand)
I was gonna save the planet, but today I got plans
I guess this is just what I am
[Chorus]
I'm an object in motion, I've lost all emotion
My two legs are broken, but look at me dance
An object in motion, don't ask where I'm going
'Cause where I am goin' is right where I am (Oh, man)
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Where I am goin' is right where I am (Oh, man)
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Where I am goin' is right where I am
[Verse 3]
(Inertia)
I wanna move out of this town
But everyone knows me
And packin' is tiring
(Inertia)
I said I would start workin' out
But I'm fuckin' hungry
And screw you, I'm tryin'
(Inertia)
I wanna be big like my plans
So why am I so tiny
And why am I so mad?
It's inertia (Inertia)
Guess this is just what I am
I'm stuck in this life
And I'm stuck in these pants
[Chorus]
I'm an object in motion, I've lost all emotion
My two legs are broken, but look at me dance (Look at me dance)
An object in motion, don't ask where I'm going
'Cause where I am goin' is right where I am (Oh, man)
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah (Don't you like it bigger, better, but you do what you can?)
Where I am goin' is right where I am (Right where I am; oh, man)
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah (Don't you like a little better, but you do what you can?)
Where I am goin' is right where I am
[Outro]
Oh, inertia
Turning Out Pt. iii=
[Verse 1: Ryan Met]
Got it out of my system, didn't I?
Did my two years on Tinder, didn't I?
Well, I wanted to be wanted
Suddenly I'm wanting more
So we got a bit tangled, didn't we?
It's the best thing that's happened to me
Got exactly what I wanted
What if I don't want this?
Am I missing something?
[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Met]
'Cause half the time I can't love right
And I can't have sex and we both get quiet
Boy, I must be one fucked-up guy
[Chorus: Ryan Met]
Oh, my God, what a crazy mind
It'll be fine, quick, let's get married
Man, I wish we were eighty-five
Thе rest of our life wouldn't sound so scary
Oh, I'm spiraling now
Let's gеt kids and a house
Though I'm riddled with doubts
Is this how we turn out?
[Verse 2: Ryan Met]
(Ah-ah) Hey, I love how you laugh when we're alone
(Ah-ah) How my dog's always happy when you're home
(Ah-ah) But my parents used to laugh too
And I think they had a dog (I don't know, I don't know)
(Ah-ah) But you're late and you're messy, aren't you?
(Ah-ah) And I need too much attention from you
(Ah-ah) Though we shrug it off as nothing
Life is pretty long, it could turn into something
[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Met]
'Cause half the time I can't love right
And I'm half yours, and you're all mine
Boy, I must be one fucked up guy
[Chorus: Ryan Met]
Oh, my God, what a crazy mind (Crazy mind)
It'll be fine, quick, let's get married (Get married)
Man, I wish we were eighty-five (Eighty-five)
The rest of our life wouldn't sound so scary
Oh, I'm spiraling now, let's get kids and a house
Though I'm riddled with doubt
Is this how we turn out?
[Post-Chorus: Ryan Met]
(Is this how we turn out?) (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
[Bridge: Ryan Met]
Everyone's got it, everyone's got it
Everyone's got it all figured out
Everyone's got it; what do I not get?
Everyone's got it all figured out
[Outro: Ryan Met]
(Everyone's got it) Don't overthink it
One day at a time, kid
Add up the days
You got someone to do life with
Don't overthink it
It's not fuckin' science
Add up the days
You got someone to do life with
(Everyone's got it) Don't overthink it
One day at a time, kid
Add up the days
You got someone to do life with
Love isn't big, kid
It's little and quiet
Let's do today
I think you'll turn out to like it
Hole in the Bottom of My Brain=
[Verse 1]
There's a hole in the bottom of my brain
But when I party, the hole goes away
But the party I throw needs a picture to post
So the world knows the party was great
There's a hole in the bottom of my brain
But when you like me, the hole goes away
[Refrain]
So there's likes and hellos
On a post on my phone of a party I throw
In the hole in the bottom of my brain
(This is how you do it right)
[Chorus]
Heads up, I'm sorry to be that guy
Heads up, I'm lookin' to just get by
Let's just say, let's just say we're fine
[Verse 2]
There's a holе in the bottom of my brain
But when you love mе, the hole goes away
And the likes on my phone, yeah, they'll start to explode
If I go and explode in L.A.
There's a hole in the bottom of my brain
If I make money, the hole goes away
[Refrain]
Now there's a thing made of gold in a home that I own
From a song that I wrote about likes and hellos
On a post on my phone of a party I throw
In the hole in the bottom of my brain
(This is how you do it right)
[Chorus]
Heads up, I'm sorry to be that guy
Heads up, I'm lookin' to just get by
Let's just say, let's just say we're fine
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Let's just say, let's just say we're fine
[Verse 3]
There's a hole in the bottom of my brain
When I spend money, the hole goes away
If I finally get clothes that are fancily sewn
I could finally be ready for fame
There's a hole in the bottom of your brain
When you get famous, the hole goes away
[Refrain]
Now there's coke on the nose of a bro I don't know
In a showroom of clothes that were fancily sewn
In a town that I loathe on a coast that gets stoked
On the thing made of gold in a home that I own
From a song that I wrote about likes and hellos
On a post on my phone of a party I throw
But I know I'm alone, no, I know I'm alone
In the hole in the bottom of my brain
The DJ is Crying for Help=
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Everyone's laughin' at me
But not like they used to
The room's spinnin' all around me
But not like I'm used to
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Hired, hired, can I get hired?
I got no skills except gettin' high
I'm tryin', tryin', I can start Friday
You've wasted your life, but thanks for applying
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Hey now, hold up, we were fun as hell
I'm all grown up, but you couldn't tell
Now I don't know what to do with myself
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
You got older 'cause you're good at life
I'm all seventeen at thirty-five
Now I don't know if there's anything else
The DJ is cryin' for help
[Post-Chorus: Jack Met, Marten Lieberman, Andy Sobelson, Alba Avoricani, Cat Capps, Rob Piccione, Ariel Gandler, Ezra Donellan, Dane Hagen & Chris Berry]
The DJ is cryin' for help
Don't know what to do with myself
Hey now, hold up, we were fun as hell
I'm all grown up but you couldn't tell
Now I don't know what to do with myself
The DJ is cryin' for help
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
Everyone's trippin' on pills
But now they're prescribed too
And everyone's stackin' their bills
But not 'cause they like to
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Oh, hired, hired, can I get hired?
Yeah, I fucked up, but I did it my way
I'm tryin', tryin', I can start Friday
Gettin' a life's a little like dyin'
[Chorus: Jack Met]
Hey now, hold up, we were fun as hell
I'm all grown up, but you couldn't tell
Now I don't know what to do with myself
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
You got older 'cause you're good at life
I'm all seventeen at thirty-five
Now I don't know if there's anything else
The DJ is cryin' for help
[Post-Chorus: Jack Met, Marten Lieberman, Andy Sobelson, Alba Avoricani, Cat Capps, Rob Piccione, Ariel Gandler, Ezra Donellan, Dane Hagen & Chris Berry, All]
Don't leave me out
The DJ is cryin' for help
Don't leave me out
Don't know what to do with myself
Hey now, hold up, we were fun as hell
I'm all grown up, but you couldn't tell
Now I don't know what to do with myself
The DJ is cryin' for help
You got older 'cause you're good at life (Don't leave me out)
I'm all seventeen at thirty-five
Now I don't know if there's anything else
The DJ is cryin' for help
[Bridge: Jack Met]
And now I'm all (I'm all) alone (Alone)
Waitin' for the beat to drop
Be kind to me, be kind and wait it out
And now I'm all (I'm all) alone (Alone)
Waitin' 'til the party starts
Be kind to me, be kind and wait it out
[Outro: Jack Met]
And now I'm all alone
Waitin' 'til the party starts
I Won't=
[Intro: Jack Met & Ryan Met]
(Hee-ha-ha-ha)
Put your hands up 'cause I won't
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't
Get your ass up 'cause I won't
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Hello, how you doin'? Am I talkin' too fast?
I'm runnin' on adrenaline and one-hour naps
'Cause I do what you tell me to and do it to death
Do it to death
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
Acapulco, Tel Aviv, and maybe Japan
And pretty people yell at me to follow the dance
So I do what you tell me to and do it to death
But I can't do this shit again
[Chorus: Jack Met, Ryan Met & Adam Met, All]
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't (My, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
I'm not here 'cause you say so (My, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
That's the way I feel
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
I don't got a body like I see in the press
So I got to the precipice of pressin' my chest
And now I look impressive with a couple of pecs
Just like my friends
[Bridge: Jack Met, Ryan Met & Adam Met]
So welcome back and take a breath
You come to life, you're bored to death
So welcome back and take a breath
You come to life, but I digress
[Chorus: Jack Met, Ryan Met & Adam Met, All]
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't (My, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
I'm not here 'cause you say so (My, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
That's the way I feel
[Bridge: Jack Met, Ryan Met & Adam Met]
So welcome back and take a breath
You come to life, you're bored to death
So welcome back and take a breath
You come to life, you're bored to death
So welcome back (And take a breath)
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met, Ryan Met & Adam Met]
Acapulco, Tel Aviv, and maybe Japan
(You've come to life, you're bored to death)
And pretty people yell at me to follow the dance
(So welcome back and take a breath)
So I do what you tell me to and do it to death
But I can't do this shit again
[Chorus: Jack Met, Ryan Met & Adam Met, All]
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't (My, oh, my; I won't)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (Right on time)
I'm not here 'cause you say so (My, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
That's the way I feel
Steve’s Going to London=
[Intro]
Steve's goin' to London
Shawn's stuck in a suit
Tom sleeps on his best friend's lawn
Like every other afternoon
Steve's goin' to London
Dan peed in the pool
Tom fell for his best friend's mom
But what the hell you gonna do?
[Verse 1]
Hey-hey, look around, look around
Wouldn't it be nice for someone to miss ya?
Hey-hey, funny how all the things
That you used to like, now they depress ya
[Pre-Chorus]
While you try to find some meaning in your life before you're gone (Ooh)
There's a song that don't mean anything at all (Ooh)
And it sounds like
[Chorus]
Steve's goin' to London
Shawn's stuck in a suit
Tom sleeps on his best friend's lawn
Like every other afternoon
Steve's goin' to London (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Dan peed in the pool (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Tom fell for his best friend's mom
But what the hell you gonna
What the hell you gonna do?
[Post-Chorus]
(Hey, hey, hey, hey; do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey; do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey; do-do-do-do-do-do)
[Verse 2]
Hey-hey, look around, look around
Wouldn't it be nice to see me on TV?
I'd dress to the nines with a smile
And you'd probably think that that was the real me
[Pre-Chorus]
While you try to find some meaning in your life before you die (Ooh)
Here's a bunch of random shit to waste your time (Ooh)
And it sounds like
[Chorus]
Steve's goin' to London (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Shawn's stuck in a suit (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Tom sleeps on his best friend's lawn
Like every other afternoon (Every other afternoon)
Steve's goin' to London (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Dan peed in the pool (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Tom fell for his best friend's mom
But what the hell you gonna
What the hell you gonna do?
[Post-Chorus]
What the hell you gonna do?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey; do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey; do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey; do-do-do-do-do-do)
[Interlude]
You'll make this rather snappy, won't you?
Ah-ah-ah (Hey)
Ah-ah-ah
[Bridge]
I try hard to write a cool song
So I start with somethin' simple like tryin' to put my shoes on
Now somethin' kinda clicked 'cause you relate a bit
But no one's gonna care about a shoe song
I try hard to write a cool song
But I gotta make it matter, so maybe I'll throw the news on
Could I relate the shoes to 2022?
Or maybe an election down in Tucson?
I try throwin' something cool on
So I'm listenin' to Kendrick and playin' the swimming pool song
But why did I do that? 'Cause now I hate my track
I'm quite aware I'll never write a cool song
But who really needs a cool song?
There's so many better melodies, why do you need a new one?
So stop writin' a song about writin' a song
You're losin' their attention, buddy, move on
[Chorus]
Steve's goin' to London (What the hell?)
Shawn's stuck in a suit
Tom sleeps on his best friend's lawn
Like every other afternoon (Every other afternoon)
Steve's goin' to London (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Dan peed in the pool (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Tom fell for his best friend's mom
But what the hell you gonna
What the hell you gonna do?
[Post-Chorus]
What the hell you gonna do?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
What the hell you gonna do?
[Outro]
Steve's goin' to London (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Steve's goin' to London (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Steve's goin' to London
Steve's goin' to London (Let's go, let's go)
Steve's goin' to London
Steve's goin' to London (I know, I know, I know)
Steve's goin' to London
Steve's goin' to London
Steve's goin' to London
Steve's goin' to London
Steve's goin' to London
God is Really Real=
[Verse 1]
My dad can't get out of bed
There's somethin' in his lungs
I think that's what the doctor said
I gotta leave for Paris now
My band goes on at 10
And my dad can't get out of bed
[Verse 2]
The Earth is spinnin' like it always did
The New York Times is publishin'
Some real important thing
And each day when the world wakes up
Our lawns will still be wet
And my dad can't get out of bed
[Chorus]
God is really real when you really, really need Him
Karma just appears when you suddenly believe it
Hear it loud and clear, just as long as it's convenient (Convenient)
Life's fuckin' long 'til it stops, and God's fuckin' fake 'til He's not
[Verse 3]
There's robots that are way too good at art
And everybody's sad now
And tryna get to Mars
Don't wanna hear your problems
'Cause there's just one in my head
And he can't get out of bed
[Verse 4]
What if we could break you out tonight?
This kind of thing happens to other dads
It don't happen to mine
I'll distract the doctors, we could sneak out with your meds
You could come along and be a roadie for the band
Come on, Dad, get out of bed
[Chorus]
God is really real when you really, really need Him
Karma just appears when you suddenly believe it
Hear it loud and clear, just as long as it's convenient (Convenient)
Life's fuckin' long 'til it stops, and God's fuckin' fake 'til He's not
[Verse 5]
Now it's late, I really gotta go
And we can't face our feelings, so we're makin' lots of jokes
And we won't cry about it, no, we'll be manly men
"I love you" sounds all corny, so I wrote this song instead
I'll sing it for you, Dad, when you get out of bed
I'll sing for you when you're out of bed
2085=
[Intro]
(You work hard for now, just now, just now)
(You work hard for now, just now, just now)
[Verse 1]
If somebody told me I'd die at forty
I wouldn'ta spent my time in bed
Writin' my dumb songs and my growin'-up songs
I shoulda just grown up instead
[Refrain]
(You work hard for now, just now, just now)
[Verse 2]
Now all of the interns are no longer interns
How long have I been outta town?
'Cause sometimes I wonder if I had kissed her
How different life would be right now
[Pre-Chorus]
I smile when I cry to hide what I felt
"I'm doin' fine," speak for yourself
I shoulda just asked for help
[Chorus]
Hey
It's 2085 and we're old as shit
Whatever
Hey
I'd hate to have to die 'fore I gеt my head
Together, whatеver
[Post-Chorus]
(You work hard for now, just now, just now)
[Verse 3]
So finish your work now, it's gettin' warm out
If you got friends, don't let them leave
I turned twenty-somethin', it didn't mean nothin'
'Cause not one of them were there to see
[Refrain]
(You work hard for now, just now, just now)
[Verse 4]
And go tell your grandson to go tell his grandson
You don't have to try so hard, ya know
'Cause I spent my whole life tryna be so liked
That only made 'em hate me more
[Pre-Chorus]
Did I make you proud? Did I screw this up?
Sing with me loud, it's all that I've got
To know if I did or not (Okay, okay)
[Chorus]
(Hey, hey) Hey
It's 2085 and we're old as shit
Whatever
Hey
I'd hate to have to die 'fore I get my head
Together, together, together, whatever
[Post-Chorus]
(You work hard for now, just now, just now)
Whatever
(You work hard for now, just now, just now)
Whatever
[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You gotta get better, you're all that I've got
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't take forever, you're not here for long
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah
You gotta get better, you're all that I've got
Ah-ah-ah-ah
[Verse 5]
I wish I was me, whoever that is
I could just be and not give a shit
Hey, I'll be whatever makes you a fan
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am
[Verse 6]
I think it's too late to figure this out
If I could be me, I would've been it by now
Maybe I'm a stone or big as my house
It looks like our time is runnin' out
[Verse 7]
So if this is me, then I'll do my best
I'll take all the shit so you'll never have to
You can be you, and I'll be the rest
Yeah, maybe that's who the hell I am
[Outro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh
You gotta get better, you're all that I've got
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't take forever, you're not here for long
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
You gotta get better, you're all that I've got
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
But don't take forever, you're not here for long
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
I gotta get better, I'm all that I've got
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
For two or three minutes, then I'm gone
