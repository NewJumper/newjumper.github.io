OK Overture=
[Intro]
These are our drums
This is our melody
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Now listen closely as our drums become our melody
And here's our song
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
[Verse 1]
So let me play my violin for you (Bang, bang, bang)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
So let me play my violin for you
The truth is that I'm screwed
Still, Joe, do you think I'm cool?
[Verse 2]
(One, two, one-one, two, three, four)
(One, two, one-one, two, three, four)
I got friends in a lot of weird places (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Wonder if they're gonna call, depending what my face is (Two, three, four)
I got friends in a lot of weird places (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Wonder if they're gonna call, depending what my facе is
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yеah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
[Verse 3]
Humpty Dumpty when, Humpty Dumpty when
Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one's around"
Humpty Dumpty when, Humpty Dumpty when
Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one, when no one
When no one's around, around, around, around"
[Interlude]
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
And I'll scream when no one, when no one, when no one's around
[Verse 4]
One day, maybe someday, I'll be so out of touch
I'll become a trumpet or a drum set in a sad orchestra
One day, maybe someday in a world speeding up
It's getting hard, so very hard to keep up
One day, maybe someday, I'll be so out of touch
I'll become a trumpet or a drum set
In a sad orchestra
One day, I won't know what to write
And I can't be eighteen my whole life
But I'm too fuckin' young to feel so fuckin' old
But I'll try and I'll try and I'll try
But I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright
[Outro]
Bang, bang, bang
But I'm way less sad
Adventure is out there
But you gotta be some—
Come on, guy
Bang, bang, bang
But it's all I have
Oh, I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright
Bummerland=
[Chorus]
Bummerland
Here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland
Give a cheer
'Cause you're only going up from here
[Verse 1]
This month
I got seven haircuts
And now my hair is all gone
It's sad, but
I've been alone for too long
So I keep getting haircuts
[Pre-Chorus]
It's my all-time low
And I just can't wait
'Cause the quicker I'm there
Is the quicker I'll say
[Chorus]
Bummerland
Here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland
Give a cheer
'Cause you're only going up from here
Bummerland
Here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland
Sorry, dear
But you're only going up from here
[Verse 2]
My friends always pay for my drinks
I can't afford no nice things
But I hope my bank account gets so low
Even zero
So next year
When I buy that first beer
I'll be a goddamn hero
[Pre-Chorus]
It's my all-time low
And I just can't wait
'Cause the quicker I'm there
Is the quicker I'll say
[Chorus]
Bummerland
Here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland
Sorry, dear
But you're only going up from here
[Bridge]
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da ('Cause you're only going up from here)
Da-da-da-da
[Pre-Chorus]
It's my all-time low
And I just can't wait
'Cause the quicker I'm there
Is the quicker I'll say
[Chorus]
Bummerland
Here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland
Give a cheer
'Cause you're only going up from here
Bummerland
Here I am
And there ain't no funner land
Bummerland
It's kinda weird
But you're only going up from here
3 O'Clock Things=
[Intro: Jack Met & The Beu Sisters]
Come on, guy
I promise everything'll be alright, be okay
Your eyes are tired, but keep 'em open
'Cause you wouldn't want to miss a thing
Come on, guy
I promise everything'll be alright, be okay
Your eyes are tired, but keep 'em open
'Cause you wouldn't wanna miss a thing
[Verse 1: Jack Met]
It's kinda funny how I paid for college
When YouTube was an option
But then I would've had to spend
My best years
Skipping ads and readin' comments
And when the hell did advertisements get so good?
They're like narcotics
So now I'm spendin' every penny I own
I should have allotted to finishing college
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2: Jack Met, Adam Met & Ryan Met]
It's kinda funny how I keep debating
If someone's shy or if they hate me
I feel like everyone I know right now
Is hooking up and getting wasted (Without me)
And maybe sex is overrated
But we're too shy to ever say it (Say it)
So we pretend we're all amazing
It's 3 AM, I should be sleeping (Sleeping)
[Chorus: Adam Met, Jack Met & Ryan Met, Jack Met &  Alba Avoricani]
Would you go runnin' if you saw the real me?
Maybe you'd love 'em, yeah, maybe you'd feel me
But I'll never ask you, no, that's super scary (Ah-ah-ah)
Sorry to bail, it's already three o'clock (Ah-ah-ah)
It's too hard to tell if anything's real or not
[Verse 3: Jack Met]
It's kinda funny how you vote for someone
To vote for someone to vote for someone
And you might end up with someone evil
But you say that he means well
If I keep on talkin' politics
My friends'll dip, they're over it
If I keep on talkin' politics
I'm Hamilton (Without the hits)
[Chorus: Adam Met, Jack Met & Ryan Met, Jack Met &  Alba Avoricani]
Would you go running if you saw the real me?
Maybe you'd love 'em, yeah, maybe you'd feel me
But I'll never ask you, no, that's super scary (Ah-ah-ah)
Sorry to bail, it's already three o'clock (Ah-ah-ah)
It's too hard to tell if anything's real or not
[Bridge: The Beu Sisters, Adam Met & Ryan Met ]
Come on, guy
I promise everything'll be alright, be okay
Your eyes are tired, but keep 'em open
'Cause you wouldn't want to miss a thing
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
[Verse 4: Jack Met]
Isn't this obvious, am I insane?
Let's blame our parents 'cause they taught us their ways
Stay out of politics, stay on the fence
Stay out of all of it to keep half your fans
Isn't this obvious? Am I insane?
There might be two sides to everything that you say
It's all a bit cloudy, but there's one thing I know
That if you're fuckin' racist, then don't come to my show
(No, we have to do one more)
[Outro: Adam Met & Ryan Met]
(Ah)
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
My Play=
[Verse 1]
I put on a play in my old house
In my cape, jumpin' on the old couch
Puttin' up lights when it's cold out
Mom and Dad, both seats sold out
Show you my play
[Verse 2]
Haven't seen the old house lately
Wonder if they found my spaceship
I don't want my own love wasted
Tell me this is what you're sayin'
[Pre-Chorus]
If you both outgrew one another
I could start now, lookin' for a lover
But if love dies, do I fuckin' bother?
[Chorus]
I just really, really, really, really wanna
Show you my play
And I don't wanna do it for Dad
At Dad's new place
I worked really, really, really, really hard
Let me show you my play
And I don't wanna do it twice
'Cause it's not the same
[Verse 3]
I've been on dates, bringin' flowers
Tryna be great for an hour
You and me might go sour
But if we don't hold out, then we're cowards
[Verse 4]
I put on a play in my basement (Basement)
Mom and Dad, smilin' faces (Faces)
But now I don't know if they faked it (Faked it)
Guess everything is complicated
[Pre-Chorus]
If you both outgrew one another
I could start now, lookin' for a lover
But if love dies, do I fuckin' bother?
[Chorus]
I just really, really, really, really wanna
Show you my play
And I don't wanna do it for Dad
At Dad's new place
I worked really, really, really, really hard
Let me show you my play
And I don't wanna do it twice
'Cause it's not the same
[Bridge]
You did everything, everything, everything that you could
We do everything, everything, everything 'til it's through
I'll do everything, everything, everything when I'm you
[Outro]
But when I show you my play
Will you pretend you didn't know
If I make a mistake?
It's gonna get really, really, really, really bad
Before it's okay
But maybe you'll forget it all
While you're watchin' my play
Joe=
[Intro]
I believed in God back in eight grade
He could smoke an eighth on a school day
Remember when you laughed at my last name?
Now I go by Met, is that less lame of a last name?
[Verse 1]
I believed in God back in '09
Always down to hang, he had no time
Yeah, but in a couple of years, I'll be so outta here
I'll have a lotta new friends and I won't even care
[Chorus]
I don't ever think of you 
I got too much stuff to do
Should have left you back in school
Joseph, do you think I'm
I don't ever think of you 
Look at all this stuff I do
I'vе played shows in Belarus, now Joe, do you think I'm cool?
[Verse 2]
I could makе a joke, but it feels strange
Every time she laughed, it would feel fake
But you could make her 
Laugh in a real way
Yeah, I still use your jokes 
And they go great
It took a little while, but I found love (Found love)
I thought you'd reply, you just thumbed up (Thumbed up)
I play a lot of shows, but you don't come (Don't come)
I don't even mind, this is so dumb, so dumb
[Chorus]
I don't ever think of you 
I got too much stuff to do
Should have left you back in school
Joseph, do you think I'm
I don't ever think of you 
Look at all this stuff I do
Probably not as much as you, still Joe, do you think I'm cool?
[Bridge]
I don't ever think of you
I don't ever think of you
I don't ever think of you
I don't ever think of you
[Verse 3]
I got friends all up the coast
Proud of all the songs I wrote
But I can't take this backpack off
It comes with me where I go
Maybe I'll put out this song
And I won't change your name at all
Maybe then you'll call me up
And you'll tell me how cool I got
Adventure Is Out There=
[Verse 1]
I keep losing my socks
Where the hell do they go?
I bet they're finally free
Floating somewhere in the sea
Do they miss my feet?
I keep losing my socks
I got nothing to wear
I bet they're at her place
A house where I can't show my face
How I wanna be there
[Chorus]
Holy moly, it's a real do-nothing day
I could change address and try another state
I could change my name, it won't do anything
Adventure is out there (Adventure is out there)
So why am I in hеre (So why am I in here) today?
[Verse 2]
Think I'm losing my mind
Apathеtic and tired 
Think where they could be
Some hotel in Germany
Hope they're loving the ride
[Chorus]
Holy moly, it's a real do-nothing day
I could change address and try another state
I could change my name, it won't do anything
Adventure is out there (Adventure is out there)
So why am I in here (So why am I in here) today?
[Verse 3]
I bought me some new socks
I won't lose them, I'm sure
And someday, hopefully
I'll slip away and they'll lose me
And I'll be seeing the world
[Chorus]
Holy moly, it's a real do-nothing day
I could change address and try another state
I could change my name, it won't do anything
Adventure is out there (Adventure is out there)
So why am I in here (So why am I in here) today?
Bang!=
[Verse 1]
I get up, I get down
And I'm jumpin' around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge
Still, I'm not feeling grown
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go!)
[Chorus]
So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody
Come hang (Come hang)
Let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try so whatever
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
[Verse 2]
Feel like I'm gonna puke
'Cause my taxes are due
Do my password begin with a one or a two?
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Metronome!)
Man, I'm up to somethin' (Up to somethin')
Oo-dee-la-dee-doe
Thank you all for comin' (All for comin')
I hope you like the show
'Cause it's on a budget (On a budget)
So ooh-dee-la-dee-doe
Yeah, come on here we go
Yeah, come on (Here we go!)
[Chorus]
So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang (Come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Bang, bang-bang-bang-bang)
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Bang, bang-bang-bang-bang, bang)
[Bridge]
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to go
So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go!)
[Chorus]
So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try so whatever
Come hang (Come hang)
Let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
(Here we go!)
Bang! Bang!
The Trick=
[Verse 1]
I got a dog and my dog can dance
Just not in public and not with my friends
I got a girl and she's twenty-eight
Now I'm the coolest guy in all of eighth grade
I know a kid that you've never met
His dad is a rock star, we smoked in his van
I know a trick, do you wanna see?
I can be anything that I pretend to be
[Chorus]
We'll get out of this, we'll get out of this too
I'm not proud of this, but I'm not proud of the truth
And if you run from me
Then I'll use my trick on you
The truth is that I'm screwed
[Verse 2]
I went to France and danced in the rain
Then told you all about it on our first date
My dad doesn't lie, so you can't meet my dad
'Cause you fell in love with the me that went to France
[Chorus]
We'll get out of this, we'll get out of this too
I'm not proud of this, but I'm not proud of the truth
And if you run from me
Then I'll use my trick on you
The truth is that we're screwed
[Outro]
We'll get out of this, 'cause I love you, I do
We'll get out of this, 'cause I love you, it's true
But if you're doubting this
If you're doubting that I do
Then oh my God, I'm screwed
Ordinaryish People (feat. Blue Man Group)=
[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Your happy friends call you depressing
'Cause you wonder why we’re all alive
Your downer friends think you're too happy, too happy
'Cause you still celebrate sometimes
Your hippie friends call you a sellout
’Cause you buckle down and get a job
You still get high but you're no hippie, no hippie
But all your work friends think you are
[Pre-Chorus]
I guess the last time you had any fun
Was way back when you weren't anyone
[Chorus]
So goodbye, ordinaryish people
We had quite the run, didn't wе, though?
But you gotta be somebody sometimе
I don't wanna pack up and leave though
When you're nobody, then nobody minds
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
Your pretty friends, they call you ugly
Your ugly friends, they call you vain
No, you're not stupid, you're just special, special
Well, that’s what all your smart friends say
[Pre-Chorus]
I guess the last time you had any fun
(Oh, the last time you had any fun)
Was way back when you weren’t anyone
(Way back when you weren't anyone)
[Chorus]
So goodbye, ordinaryish people
We had quite the run, didn’t we, though?
But you gotta be somebody sometime
I don't wanna pack up and leave, though
When you're nobody, then nobody minds
[Outro]
Your attention, please
Please yell if you're paying attention
I don’t wanna pack up and leave though
When you're nobody, then nobody minds
Humpty Dumpty=
[Chorus]
Humpty Dumpty, when Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one's around"
(Okay)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Okay)
[Verse 1]
Something's wrong
But I'm scared to look it up
If I do that and no one has it
I'll feel so alone
Something's wrong
But don't pity me for long
If you get sad, then I'll feel bad
That I told you at all
[Pre-Chorus]
I got friends in a lot of weird places
Wonder if they're gonna call
Depending what my face is, what my face is
I could fake it, I could move away
Or I could suck it up and face it
[Chorus]
Humpty Dumpty, when Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no onе's around"
Humpty Dumpty, when Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
Hе said, "Screw it, there's a big crowd looking
I'ma scream when no one, when no one, when no one's around"
(Okay)
[Verse 2]
Look outside, they're making snowmen on your street
Underneath your pillow, you can sigh yourself to sleep
Look outside, they're making snowmen on your street
Hide behind your pillow, close the window
'Cause you know you can't be seen
[Pre-Chorus]
I got friends in a lot of weird places
Wonder if they're gonna call
Depending what my face is
If I can't breathe, then you can't see
But aren't you excited that I'm giving you the best me?
[Chorus]
Humpty Dumpty, when Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one's around"
Humpty Dumpty, when Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, there's a big crowd looking
I'ma scream when no one, when no one, when no one's around"
When no one, when no one's around
[Bridge]
If I try to keep my tears in my eyes
Would you like me? Would you like me? Would you like me?
If I try to keep my tears in my eyes
Would you like me? Would you like me? Would you like me?
[Pre-Chorus]
I got shows in a lot of weird places
Wonder if they're gonna come
Depending what my face is
Remember Vegas?
I can't take another panic episode
When I get off the stage, man
[Chorus]
Humpty Dumpty, when Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one's around" (When no one's around)
Humpty Dumpty, when Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said, "Screw it, there's a big crowd looking
I'ma scream when no one, when no one, when no one's around"
[Outro]
When no one, when no one's around
(When no one, when no one, when no one's around)
When no one, when no one's around
World's Smallest Violin=
[Verse 1]
My grandpa fought in World War II
He was such a noble dude
I can't even finish school
Missed my mom and left too soon
His dad was a fireman
Who fought fires so violent
I think I bored my therapist
While playing him my violin
[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh my god) That's so insane
(Oh my god) That's such a shame
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad
I kinda feel like two things can be sad (One, two, three, four)
[Chorus]
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon (That's right, that's right)
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
My grandpa fought in World War II
And he was such a noble dude
Man, I feel like such a fool
I got so much left to prove
All my friends have vaping friends
They'rе so good at making friends
I'm so scared of caving in
Is that entеrtaining yet?
[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh my god) That's so insane
(Oh my god) That's such a shame
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad
I kinda feel like two things can be sad (One, two, three, four)
[Chorus]
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon (That's right, that's right)
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Somewhere in the universe
Somewhere someone's got it worse
Wish that made it easier
Wish I didn't feel the hurt
[Chorus]
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon
[Outro]
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
All up and down a city street
While tryna put my mind at ease
Like finishing this melody
This feels like a necessity
So this could be the death of me
Or maybe just a better me
Now, come in with the timpanis
And take a shot of Hennessy
I know I'm not there mentally
But you could be the remedy
So let me play my violin for you
Way Less Sad=
[Verse 1]
I should move
'Cause New York is getting muddy out
There's LA
But it's always kinda sunny out
And I don't wanna hurt no more
So I set my bar real low
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling
[Chorus]
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
[Post-Chorus]
But I'm way less sad
But I'm way less sad
[Verse 2]
I wake up
And I'm not so mad at Twitter now
Living sucks
But it's sucking just a little now
And I don't wanna cry no more
So I set my bar real low
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling
[Chorus]
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you lovе it?
No, I ain't happy yet (Happy yet), but I'm way less sad
I may bе wrong, I may be wrong
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
[Bridge]
Well, I can't fall asleep, and I'm losing my mind
'Cause it's half-past three and my brain's on fire
I been counting sheep, but the sheep all died
And I'm trying too hard, but I can't not try
Well, I can't fall asleep, and I'm losing my mind
'Cause it's half-past three and my brain's on fire
I been counting sheep, but the sheep all died
And I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright
[Chorus]
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet (Happy yet), but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
[Outro]
Christmas in June=
[Intro]
Ok, I'm ready
[Verse 1]
New Year's Eve
I was at a festival in New Orleans
You were in Tribeca kissing nobody
I owe you one, yes, I do
Valentine's Day
We decided we would do the whole damn thing
But I played to an empty gym at Iowa State
I guess I owe you that too
[Pre-Chorus]
I try so hard to be so happy, are you happy too?
Doo, doo, doo, doo
[Chorus]
Plan on this
You're no longer gonna be the plan I miss
I won't ever let you down
But just in case, can we do Christmas in June?
Oh my God
How lucky am I to have two things I love?
Makes it that much easiеr to fuck it up
In case I miss it, can we do Christmas in June?
[Verse 2]
I skippеd prom
I thought I would blow up from that radio spot
Remember how you chuckled when you heard that song?
But you won't be laughing soon
One big day
One big show'll make 'em know my name
But if it ends up falling on our wedding day
Oh God, don't make me choose
[Pre-Chorus]
I try so hard to be so happy, are you happy, too?
I know you try to
[Chorus]
Plan on this
You're no longer gonna be the plan I miss
I won't ever let you down
But just in case, can we do Christmas in June?
Oh my God (Oh my God)
How lucky am I to have two things I love? (Things I love)
Makes it that much easier to fuck it up
I hate to do this, can we do Christmas in June?
[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus]
Plan on this
You're no longer gonna be the plan I miss
I won't ever let you down
But just in case, can we do Christmas in June?
Oh my God
How lucky am I to have two things I love?
Makes it that much easier to fuck it up
I hate to do this, don't wanna lose this
Can we do Christmas in June?
[Outro]
Hold on, love
A little longer while I get the album done
And if I get to tour it, wouldn't that be fun?
But that's one less month with you 
Holy shit
Now I'm sittin' thinking 'bout what else I'll miss
Darling, if we're ever gonna have a kid
Don't wanna miss it, can we just have him in June?
