Record Player (with AJR)=
[Chorus: Daisy the Great]
I've got a record player that was made in 2014
Dyed my hair blue, it came out a seasick sort of green
I like vintage dresses when they fall just below my knees
I pretend I scraped them climbing in the trees
I've got a record player that was made in 2014
Dyed my hair blue, it came out a seasick sort of green
I like vintage dresses when they fall just below my knees
I pretend I scraped them climbing in the trees
[Verse 1: Jack Met & Daisy the Great]
I'm in an elevator, it's goin' down, down, down
I spent forever with my feet on the ground
But not now
'Cause I don't wanna do the wrong thing
Guess I gotta go and get famous for doin' nothing
[Pre-Chorus 1: Jack Met & Daisy the Great]
Da, da, da-da, da, da
Crack a smile, crack a smile
Da da da-da da da
Stay a while, stay a while
Da, da, da-da, da, da
Am I holdin' for applause?
Is it gone? Is this on?
[Chorus: Daisy the Great]
I've got a record player that was made in 2014
Dyed my hair blue, it came out a seasick sort of green
I like vintage dresses when they fall just below my knees
I pretend I scraped them climbing in the trees
I've got a record player that was made in 2014
Dyed my hair blue, it came out a seasick sort of green
I like vintage dresses when they fall just below my knees
I pretend I scraped them climbing in the trees
[Verse 2: Jack Met]
I'm in the simulator, I'm doin' a-okay
But every day is just rewind and replay
Not today (Ah)
I'll head out to Monterey
Throw my phone into the waves
Can you see it in my eyes? Am I finally awake?
[Pre-Chorus 2: Daisy the Great & Jack Met]
Da, da, da-da, da, da
Crack a smile, crack a smile
Da, da, da-da, da, da
Stay a while, stay a while
Da, da, da-da, da, da
I think the best is yet to come
So drink up and good luck
[Chorus: Daisy the Great]
I've got a record player that was made in 2014
Dyed my hair blue, it came out a seasick sort of green
I like vintage dresses when they fall just below my knees
I pretend I scraped them climbing in the trees
I've got a record player that was made in 2014 (Sometimes I think all I'm ever doin' is)
Dyed my hair blue, it came out a seasick sort of green (Tryin' to convince myself I'm alive)
I like vintage dresses when they fall just below my knees (Sometimes I think all I'm ever doin' is)
I pretend I scraped them climbing in the trees (Tryin' to convince myself I'm alive)
[Outro: Daisy the Great]
Sometimes I think all I'm ever doin' is
Tryin' to convince myself I'm alive
Sometimes I think all I'm ever doin' is
Tryin' to convince myself I'm climbing in the trees
All My Favorite Songs (feat. AJR)=
[Chorus]
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
All my favorite people make me mad
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 1]
I love parties, but I don't go
Then I feel bad when I stay home
'Cause I need a friend when I take a walk
I like spacin' out when somebody talks
I wanna be rich, but I feel guilty
I fall in love with everyone who hates me
[Chorus]
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
All my favorite people make me mad, so mad
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 2]
Dreamy morning
Walkin' alone by myself
Thinkin' about life
And tryin' to find my way through hell
Sometimes I wish
I was on an island
But then I'd miss
The sound of sirens
[Chorus]
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
All my favorite people make me mad, so mad
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
I don't know what's wrong with me
I don't know what's wrong with me
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Outro]
Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Dear Winter 2.0=
[Verse 1]
Dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I hope they don't make fun of you
When you grow up and go to school, okay?
'Cause Winter is a badass name
Dear Winter, I hope you talk to girls
Or boys or anyone you like
I just hope you don't stay in every night
'Cause I wish I was out tonight
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
It really doesn't seem like there's anyone for me
But dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I'm hoping that some day, I can meet you on this Earth
But shit, I gotta meet your mom first
[Verse 2]
Dear Winter, I hope you like this song
And even when you're 13
And you scream at me for parenting you wrong
I hope it's still a badass song
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
It really doesn't seem like there's anyone for me
But dear Winter, I hope you like your name
You know I cannot wait to teach you how to curse
But shit, I gotta meet your mom first
[Verse 3]
Dear Winter, don't move too far away
And please don't say I'm hovering
When I text you to ask about your day
I wanna hear about your day
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Will we still hang out and talk when I'm no longer in charge?
Oh, dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I hope you let me take a shot with you on your 21st
But shit, you gotta ask your mom first
[Outro]
Dear Winter, I'm looking for your mom
I gotta find a girl that doesn't mind that I'm inside my head a lot
Winter, it won't be too long
First, I just gotta find your mom
