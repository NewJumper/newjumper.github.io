Espresso=
[Chorus]
Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
[Verse 1]
I can't relate to desperation
My give-a-fucks are on vacation
And I got this one boy and he won't stop calling
When they act this way, I know I got 'em
[Pre-Chorus]
(Mm) Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
(Mm) Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
(Mm) Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
(Yes) I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
(Yes) That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
(Yes) One touch and I brand-newed it for ya (Ooh)
[Chorus]
And now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
[Post-Chorus]
Holy shit
Is it that sweet? I guess so (Mm)
[Verse 2]
I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer
Oh, he looks so cute wrapped 'round my finger
My twisted humor make him laugh so often
My honeybee, come and get this pollen
[Pre-Chorus]
(Mm) Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
(Mm) Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
(Mm) Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya (Ayy, ayy, oh)
(Yes) I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
(Yes) That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
(Yes) One touch and I brand-newed it for ya (Stupid)
[Chorus]
Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso (Yes)
Thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so (Yes)
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso (Yes)
Move it up, down, left, right, oh (Move it up, down, left, right, oh)
Switch it up like Nintendo (Yes)
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
[Outro]
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Mm, that's that me espresso
Honeymoon Fades=
[Intro]
I hope we stay the same, hey
Honeymoon
[Verse 1]
Unexpected, this thing that we fell into
Like, so connected
You came at a time when my heart was selective
Didn't have to choose, my love was accepted, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm learning you like 101
You were sent to me like a one of one
And now we're going hard, just one on one
Nobody else
[Chorus]
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope that we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades
[Post-Chorus]
After the honeymoon fades, yeah
[Verse 2]
Now remember when we met, we was all in each other's bed
And we were spending every second we had
And now that it's official, it's hittin' a little different
What the hell we gonna do with these bags? No, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm learning you like 101
You were sent to me like a one of one
And now we're going hard, just one on one
Nobody else
[Chorus]
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope that we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades (I hope that we)
[Post-Chorus]
(Can you feel it with me? Can you feel it with me?)
After the honeymoon fades
(Can you feel it with me? Can you feel it with me?)
(Can you feel it with me? Can you feel it with me?)
(Can you feel it with me? Can you feel it with me?)
[Bridge]
And I hope it tastes the same, mmm
Even if it's bittersweet
[Refrain]
Honeymoon fading with you (Fading with you)
Honeymoon fading with you (Fading with you)
Honeymoon fading with you (Fading with you)
Honeymoon fading, fading
[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
On My Way=
[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
I need a moment before I go, it's nothing personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand
[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So then, when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favorite girl
[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
[Instrumental Break: Farruko]
Blep, yah, yah
Farru
Yah-yah-yah-yah
[Verse 2: Farruko]
Lo siento mucho (Farru), pero me voy (Eh)
Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy (Eh-ey)
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errores, también soy humano
Y tú no ves que lo hago porque te amo (Pu-pu-pu-pum)
[Pre-Chorus: Farruko]
Pero ya (Ya), no tengo más na' que hacer aquí (Aquí)
Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir (Partir)
De mi propio camino, seguiré lejos de ti
[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise (Is on the rise, na-na)
The fire burning in my eyes (The fire burning in my eyes, no)
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
[Instrumental Break: Farruko]
Blep
I'm on my way
[Bridge: Sabrina Carpenter]
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody on my way
[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
