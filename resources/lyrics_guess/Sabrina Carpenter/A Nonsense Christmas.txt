A Nonsense Christmas=
[Intro]
It's the holiday remix
Ah-ah
[Verse 1]
Think I only want you under my mistletoe
I might change your contact to "Has a Huge North Pole"
You said you like my stockings better on the floor
Boy, I've been a bad girl, I guess I'm gettin' coal, no
[Pre-Chorus]
Let me come warm you up, you been out in the snow
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like, "Ho, ho, ho"
I don't want Santa's elves underneath this ol' tree
Here's a lil' carol I wrote, it's about you and me (Me)
[Chorus]
You're my wish list
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' Christmas
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin'
And when you're comin' down the chimney
Oh, it feels so good
I need that Charles Dickens
You'll be Santa Claus and I'll be Mrs. 
I'll take you for a ride, I'll be your Vixen
I don't even know, I'm talkin' Christmas
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
[Verse 2]
I'm talkin' deckin' all the halls
I'm talkin' spikin' eggnog
I'm talkin' opposite of small
I'm talkin' big snowballs
You got a new toy for me
I'm out here trimmin' the tree
I caught that holiday glee
My true love gave it to me
[Pre-Chorus]
Let me come warm you up, you been out in the snow
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like, "Ho, ho, ho, ho"
And I don't want Santa's elves (Don't want) underneath this ol' tree (Tree)
Here's a lil' carol I wrote (Yeah), it's about you and me
[Chorus]
You're my wish list (Wish list)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' Christmas (Christmas)
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin' (When we're kissin')
And when you're comin' down the chimney
Oh, it feels so good
I need that Charles Dickens (No)
You'll be Santa Claus and I'll be Mrs. (Mrs., uh)
I'll take you for a ride, I'll be your Vixen
I don't even know, I'm talkin' Christmas (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm talkin' (Talkin'), I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Talkin')
[Bridge]
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Na-na-na), I'm talkin'
(Blah-blah, blah-blah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah (Ah-ah)
I'm talkin' chestnuts (Talkin')
I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
[Outro]
Look at all those presents, that's a big sack
Boy, that package is too big to gift wrap
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a Christ-smash
How quickly can you build a snowman? Think fast
Oh
Nonsense=
[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh, la-la)
Da-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to "Don't Leave Me Alone"
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-blee"
I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me (Me)
[Chorus]
I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
[Verse 2]
I'm talkin' all around the clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
I'm talkin' opposite of soft
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?
[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-bleh-blee"
And I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep (Too deep)
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me
[Chorus]
I'll be honest (Honest)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense (Nonsense)
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in (When you walk in)
When you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense (Oh-oh)
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
[Bridge]
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Na-na-na), I'm talkin'
(Blah-blah, blah-blah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah (Ah-ah)
I don't even know anymore
(Oh)
[Outro]
This song catchier than chickenpox is
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a pop hit, ha-ha
How quickly can you take your clothes off? Pop quiz
That one's not gonna make it
Most of these aren't gonna make—
