Almost Love=
[Intro]
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
The moment when the light is red before the go
The moment when the curtain's down before the show
The moment when you're done, but maybe just one more
That's how I feel before I get you all alone
[Pre-Chorus]
We could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
When we could push all the limits
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shirt hanging off my shoulders
Both hands wanna hold ya
So baby, what's the hold up?
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Almost love, it's almost love
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Almost love, it's almost love
[Post-Chorus]
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost lo-lo-love
Almost love, but it could be love
It could be love
It could be, yeah
[Verse 2]
I want you like a midnight hour wants a view
I want you like a loner wants an empty room
I want you like a kiss that's long and overdue
I need you more than I have ever needed you
[Pre-Chorus]
And we could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
When we could push all the limits
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shirt hanging off my shoulders
Both hands wanna hold ya
So baby, what's the hold up?
Yeah
[Chorus]
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Almost love, it's almost love
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Almost love, it's almost love
[Post-Chorus]
Almost love
It's almost love, but it could be love
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Almost love, but it could be love
It could be love
It could be, yeah, oh no
[Bridge]
We could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
[Chorus]
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're getting it so close
Now you're getting this so close
Almost love, almost love
Oh, 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
It's almost love
[Post-Chorus]
Almost love, oh baby, oh
It's almost love, but it could be love
'Cause it's almost love, but it could be love
Almost love and you know
Almost love
But it could be love
'Cause it's almost love, but it could be love
Yeah, it could be love, eh
Paris=
[Verse 1]
If I asked that boy to jump, I know he would
He don't even have to say, it's understood
He treat me nice, he treat me right, he treat me good
Still I get so hesitant, still I get so hesitant
So I took myself where I think I should be
Something told me that it's waiting here for me
Parisian nights, Parisian high, Parisian breeze
Feeding me like medicine, feeding me like medicine, yeah
[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
Yeah, I already have love in L.A. 
[Verse 2]
If you show me too much love, it makes me leave (Makes me leave)
Guess that's one of many things that's wrong with me (That's wrong with me)
Looking past you when you're right in front of me
I won't do that anymore, I won't do that anymore (Anymore)
Why'd it take so long for me to know this? (Know this)
Scared to put the water with the roses (Roses)
Halfway 'cross the world for me to notice
But I notice, yeah, I notice, yeah
[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
[Bridge]
Je ne voulais pas trouver l'amour
Mais Paris a quelque chose
Qui donne envie d'aimer, d'aimer passionnément
Mon cœur est à toi pour toujours
You will always have my heart
[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. (Already have love)
It's so romantic in Paris (So romantic in Paris)
Won't even try to compare it (I know that I try)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
It's so romantic in Paris, babe
Won't even try to compare it (Won't even try, won't even try)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it (Thought I was sure, I was sure)
But I already have love in L.A. 
But I already have love in L.A.
Hold Tight=
[Intro: Sabrina Carpenter]
Ah
[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
Done everything and done it again
Not every party needs our attendance
[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Don't take this as complaining
Just little rearrangements
All the nights that we've been takin'
Maybe we could take one off
[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah (I just wanna, I just wanna hold tight)
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]
Not like I wanna keep you inside, yeah
But I was hoping we could switch up how we're spending our time
[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Don't take this as complaining
Just little rearrangements
All the nights that we've been takin'
Maybe we could take one off
[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah (I just wanna, I just wanna hold tight)
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
[Verse 3: UHMEER & Sabrina Carpenter]
I just want that hand hold with the sweat in the middle
Running down to when I feel alone and the feeling gone, you can touch it a little
Hear me underneath the covers coloring your body, reading Braille
Take you to Bahamas, seeping through the sand
Sucking on the silence, now I'm in your ear
Telling you, baby, to listen, I just
Wanna keep you in, wanna keep you in right
Wanna feel your skin, wanna feel it on mine
Maybe I been on the Internet forgetting how to keep it slow
But no, I need it bitty bad bone Bonnie Clyde, come and get it
I don't know, I get it, get it, I get it, oh
[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out (Gotta go out), we don't ever slow down
(Gotta slow down, down)
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah (We keep going, we going)
(I just wanna, I just wanna hold tight)
Always gotta go out (Always gotta go out), we don't ever slow down
(Gotta slow down)
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Sue Me=
[Verse 1]
Remember when you said it, there's no second chance?
Oh, baby, I heard you been hoping you could change the past
You miss the long goodnights, you miss the long goodbyes
You miss the long goodnights (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
Well, did you ever think that it was hard for me
To walk it off like nothing happened, nonchalantly?
I got you feeling like, I got you feeling right
I got you feeling like (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
[Pre-Chorus]
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself can't be illegal, illegal
[Chorus]
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me for being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me
[Verse 2]
(Go)
It's hard to see me on when you been off as hell
But I'm not gonna dull myself because you dull yourself
I know it's hard to see what you don't want to see
I know it's hard to see (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
[Pre-Chorus]
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself can't be illegal, illegal
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I, I, I
I guess I'm hard to ignore
Pick up that jaw off the floor
[Chorus]
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
(Everything right, no, no, everything right, no, no, oh)
So sue me for being good friends with your friends

And running into you the place that we met

For being something you can't forget

prfct=
[Intro]
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh no
[Verse 1]
You can get real close, talkin', you talkin' now
Underneath our clothes, pretend that we know it all
Shut off the lights just to hide in the dark
(Hide in the) Dark, (Hide in the) dark
Think that I know you the farther you are
(Farther you are, farther you are) No
[Pre-Chorus]
Like A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kind of thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge
(Wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel)
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess
[Chorus]
Like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need
(That's what we need)
[Verse 2]
See right through the fiction and all of this fakery
(All of this fakery)
Just give me some friction, let me see what nobody sees
(See what nobody sees)
You don't think that I can handle the truth
(Handle the truth, handle the truth)
Baby, I'm over just playing it cool, no
[Pre-Chorus]
Like A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kind of thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge
(Wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel)
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess
[Chorus]
Like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
(And you know that I'm with you, baby)
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
(And I know it could be worth it, baby)
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need
[Bridge]
That's what we need (That's what we need)
That's what we need (That's what we need)
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?
That's what we need
That's what we need
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?
[Chorus]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
(What you need, you and I)
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
(Oh, will you give it to me, baby?)
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
(Mess with me, honey)
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need
(And you know, and you know, know, know)
[Outro]
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect)
That's what we need, that's what we need
(But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it)
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?
(And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara)
That's what we need, that's what we need
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need
Bad Time=
[Intro]
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time
[Verse 1]
You never finish your glass, take a little sip and you're bored
Down in the apartment below, wouldn't even open your door
You said, "It's a bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time" (Mm)

Mona Lisa=
[Verse 1]
Keep it casual, don't have to tippy-toe
Take your cares off, just stay a couple more
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Go and get a little closer
Playing mind games, we don't do that here
So put your bid in before I disappear
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Come and get a little closer
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay?
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you
Wasting your time, should be making that move
Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa
What's on my mind, I've been thinking maybe
I could be yours by the time that we leave
Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh
[Verse 2]
I know your type, what's with the timid behavior?
You let this ooh-la-la-la intimidate ya
Don't you make me, don't you make me leave on my own
I'm already ready, come on
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay?
Yeah, yeah

I could be yours by the time that we leave
Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh
