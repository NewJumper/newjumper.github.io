Eyes Wide Open=
[Intro]
La-di-da-da-da-na
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Everybody loves to tell me
I was born an old soul
Better keep my eyes wide open
There's so much that I don't know
Just another hotel room
Never felt so all alone
I think about my granddad's eyes
And they always send me home
I can almost hear him now
I gotta make him proud
[Chorus]
I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground, unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open
[Verse 2]
I can't see two steps ahead of me
When the fog comes rollin' in
I never thought I'd miss the rain
Lord knows how long it's been
This dream burns inside of me
And I can't just let it go
There's still so much that I don't know
[Chorus]
I keep my eyes wide open (No)
Bless this ground, unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open (Yeah)
[Bridge]
All I have is just this moment
I don't wanna miss a second
'Cause it could all be gone in an instant
Yeah, in an instant
[Chorus]
I keep my eyes wide open (Open)
Bless this ground, unbroken (Yeah)
I'm about to make my way (Make my way)
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open
[Outro]
(Keep my eyes wide open)
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
(Keep my eyes wide open)
And my eyes wide open
I keep my eyes wide open
Can't Blame a Girl for Trying=
[Verse 1]
Here I am again, the same old situation
Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated?
I should've played it cool, instead, I made a fool
Oh, the things I do
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
No, you canâ€™t blame a girl for trying
Uh-uh-uh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
I should've shut my mouth, I could've kept it quiet
I might have freaked him out 'cause I was so excited
But I just couldn't wait, I took a leap of faith
Oh, the things I say
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh, no-oh-oh-oh, no
[Bridge]
And I think sometimes
I tend to be my own worst enemy
And maybe someday
I'm gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue
Doing what I do
[Verse 3]
And just as I'm giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one, it's so intoxicating
Being where I've been, I know that in the end
I'll do it all again
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, love will find me, there ain't no denying
That you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Mmm, uh-uh-uh-mmm-mmm
The Middle of Starting Over=
[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
Cast out to sea
Drifting with the tide
And no way of finding me
Now that I'm free
Nothing but blue skies
Paradise in front of me
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Awake from this dream
I hold my breath and just believe
[Chorus]
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over
[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
Alone in a room
Tearing down the walls
Painting over scars and bruises
Now this is home
Fill it up with love
And make the best of something new, yeah
[Pre-Chorus 2]
As hard as it seems
I hold my breath and just believe
[Chorus]
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
[Bridge]
The colors and the stars seem a little brighter (Oh-oh)
Tomorrow isn't far away (Not far away, oh-oh)
Through the hardest part
I'm working towards a happy ending
[Chorus]
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time (Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind (Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Chance to do it over, get it right this time (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over
[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll Be The Stars=
[Verse 1]
We are young, we are gold
Trying things we didn't know
Looking at the sky
See it come alive
All our fears became our hopes
Climbed out every locked window
We rode a lion's mane
And fell upon the rain
[Pre-Chorus 1]
We can reach the constellations
Trust me, all our dreams are breaking out
[Chorus]
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
Yeah, all we really need is us
Don't be scared to close your eyes
No, we're never gonna die
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close your eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
[Verse 2]
Let me in
Hold me close
Fill my heart with simple notes
So when it's hard to see
They are there reminding me
Take my breath
And hold me high
So I can feel the city lights
Glowing under me
It's in our reach
[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're breaking out
[Chorus]
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
Yeah, all we really need is us
Don't be scared to close your eyes
No, we're never gonna die
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close your eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
[Bridge]
We can reach the constellations
Trust me, all our dreams are breaking out
[Chorus]
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
All we really need is us
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close your eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah, we'll be the stars
Two Young Hearts=
[Verse 1]
It's a narrow line I'm walking
Better watch my step
'Cause we got everybody talking
And I can hear 'em say
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe in another lifetime
Maybe when you're older
What they don't know is
I've already made up my mind (my mind)
And yes, I know what love is
[Chorus]
'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls
With two young hearts
Two young hearts
They say we're too young
[Verse 2]
I could lie awake in darkness
Oh, just to dream of you
And you could lay your head on my chest
Yeah, just like you always do
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe in another lifetime
Maybe when we're older
At least we know that
We've already made up our minds
And yes, we know what love is
[Chorus]
'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls
With two young hearts
Two young hearts, oh
[Bridge]
We're gonna keep on running
Running for all that we are
We want it all or nothing
We knew it right from the start
We are a part of something
Something as old as time, time, time
[Chorus]
'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls
With two young hearts
Two young hearts
[Outro]
You're never too young
Your Love's Like=
[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
Sometimes life gets bitter
I get strung out
Caught in the middle
And I can't breathe
I just need a little taste of paradise
[Pre-Chorus]
I know a place I can escape to
Where I go
Troubles never break through
The grass is greener
My head is clearer
I got peace of mind when I fall into your eyes
[Chorus]
Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinning in my head
Keep it play-playing on repeat
It's like flowers in the spring time
Every day is Valentine's
So good it's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight
Dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
That's what your love
That's what your love's like (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
[Verse 2]
Stop signs
I keep on running into
Red lights
Make me wanna scream like
Why can't it just be
Only you and me all the time
In a world no one can find
[Chorus]
Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinning in my head
Keep it play-playing on repeat
It's like flowers in the spring time
Every day is Valentine's
So good it's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight
Dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
That's what your love
That's what your love's like (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
[Bridge]
When life has left me numb
And I need a pick me up
There's no better rush than your love
Your love
Your love
[Chorus]
Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinning in my head
Keep it play-playing on repeat
It's like walking on the ceiling
Can't compare the feeling
Better than I could ever describe
It's like soaking in the sunrise
Not a worry on my mind
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
That's what your love
That's what your love's like (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
That's what your love
That's what your love's like (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
That's what your love
That's what your love's like (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
That's what your love's like
Too Young=
[Verse 1]
Big lights
People rushing to grow up, before you know
Stop signs
Denied
Everyone tells me I gotta go slow
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But nothing can change my mind
[Chorus]
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
[Verse 2]
Rain drops
Deep thoughts
Pictures of you and me wherever I go
Laughing
Running to a place where nobody says "no"
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But I've got to fall to fly, yeah
[Chorus]
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
[Interlude]
'Cause I'm not too young, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
And if I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
And if I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
'Cause I'm not too young, no
'Cause I'm not too young
Seamless=
[Verse 1]
Good morning, you're leaving
I'll see you in the evening
My best friend 'til the end
My better half, no pretend
Our language is sacred
Though people try to solve it
New adventures on the way
[Chorus]
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you, I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah, we're seamless
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
We're klutzy, but so lucky
That I always have you to catch me
We're partners in crime
You're stuck with me your whole life
So different
Out of our minds
From a planet that's hard to find
Every second every day
[Chorus]
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you, I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah, we're seamless
[Bridge]
You're right by my side whenever I need you
Through the hardest times, I'll be there for you
At the crack of dawn when the moon is gone
I won't be hard to find
'Cause you and me, oh yeah, we're seamless
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, hey
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah
[Chorus]
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you, I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah, we're seamless
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, hey
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Right Now=
[Verse 1]
We'll never be as young as we are right now
We'll never see the world like we do right now
So take in what's around you
Put your camera down
Take a shot
Give it all you got
I have a way of getting stuck on yesterday
I tend to miss the little things that come my way
Always looking forward
Always looking back
They seem so near
But they're not here
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause time moves on so quickly
Without or with me
I've got to take a breath
[Chorus]
And slow down, slow down
My mind is racing
Catch up, catch up
I've gotta pace myself
I'm always wondering
But I don't need to go right now
Let go, let go (let go)
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin (begin)
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've gotta make this moment last
Right now
[Verse 2]
Have you ever noticed how your heartbeat feels
When your love is so excited?
'Cause it's getting real
Have you stopped to listen
To what's in your soul?
That's your intuition
And it always knows
[Pre-Chorus]
Time moves on so quickly
Without or with me
I've got to take a breath
[Chorus]
And slow down, slow down
My mind is racing
Catch up, catch up
I've gotta pace myself
I'm always wondering
But I don't need to go right now
Let go, let go (let go)
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin (begin)
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've gotta make this moment last
Right now
[Breakdown]
Oh, right now (Right now)
Right now (Right now)
Enjoy the ride
The ride that you're on
Right now
Right now
Yeah
[Outro]
Let go, let go
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've gotta make this moment last
Right now
Darling I'm a Mess=
[Verse 1]
This might be wrong, but he's all I know
He's all I know
Most times, I pretend that he's just a friend
He's just a friend
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine
[Chorus]
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss
[Verse 2]
Your lips I'll miss 'cause they're all I know
I can't let you go
And I won't forget all that you said
It's engraved in my head
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine
[Chorus]
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss
No, oh, a goodbye kiss
[Bridge]
Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine
[Chorus]
But darling, I'm a mess without your love (Without your love)
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by (No, no, no, no, no)
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss (One more goodbye)
White Flag=
[Verse 1]
Take, take it all away
Save my heart for another day
I'm up late on the telephone
And I'm all alone with the dial tone
Wait, wait 'til the sun is up
Drown my dreams in a coffee cup
Palms out, wanna beg for luck
But I'm way too proud
Never giving up
[Chorus]
Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give
And something's got to break
I know someday it's gonna happen
Someday it's gonna give
Can't always be this way
And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under
It won't upset me
I'll go down
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down
Not forever
Just for now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 2]
Give, give everything I've got
Out of reach, but I'll take a shot
Kick rocks in the parking lot
Feel like giving up
But I'll never stop
Run, run, running like a fool
Never win if you never lose
Find hope and a little truth
Gonna learn new tricks
Gotta jump through hoops
[Chorus]
Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give
And something's got to break
I know someday it's gonna happen
Someday it's gonna give
Can't always be this way
And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under
It won't upset me
I'll go down
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down
Not forever
Just for now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Bridge]
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever, not forever
Won't stay down
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever, not forever
Won't stay down
[Chorus]
And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under
It won't upset me
And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under
It won't upset me
I'll go down
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down
Not forever
Just for now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Repeat]
And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under
It won't upset me
And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under
It won't upset me
I'll go down
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down
Not forever
Just for now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Best Thing I Got=
[Verse 1]
So what if I just wanna be
A little bit out of my mind?
I let you take my heart and I like it
So what if I happen to be
A little bit out of my mind?
I bet I'll steal your heart and you'll like it
[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't think it's any kind of secret
I feel you from a million miles away
[Chorus]
And your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing
The best thing that I got
[Verse 2]
I know sometimes it seems like I
I'm just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it
And sometimes I can tell that I
I'm just a little out of time
I make you skip a beat and I know it
[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't think it's any kind of secret
I think of you a billion times a day
[Chorus]
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing
The best thing that I got
[Bridge]
So don't feel lonely tonight
You know I'll never be hard to find
So don't go out of your mind (Out of your mind)
You know I'll never be too hard to find
[Breakdown]
I know sometimes it seems like I
I'm just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it
[Chorus]
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing
The best thing that I got
[Outro]
Your love is the best thing
And it's only just begun
It's the best thing
