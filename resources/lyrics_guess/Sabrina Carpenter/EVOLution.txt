On Purpose=
[Verse 1]
Your eyes crashin' into my eyes
Was I accidentally falling in love?
Your words didn't mean to heal the hurt
We're coincidentally more than enough
[Pre-Chorus 1]
All these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you
[Chorus]
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
[Post-Chorus]
(Go) Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
(Go) Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
[Verse 2]
My dreams running into your dreams
It's as if we wished on the same star
And my time changing all of your time
It's a butterfly effect on my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
All these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew? Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you
Oh, whoa
[Chorus]
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
[Post-Chorus]
(Go) Hey, huh (On purpose)
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
(Go) Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
[Bridge]
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
Oh, you're scared
[Chorus]
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
[Outro]
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Feels Like Loneliness=
[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
You're not asking for much, but
It just seems like a lot, and
Kinda confused, don't know what to choose
But baby, it's hard for me, I'm not ready for your love (Yeah)
I keep on the go, but
I don't mean to tease ya
You're down on your knees, you're beggin' me, "please"
But darling, it's not the way to get me, baby, no (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think we could be a thing
I gave you everything, love
[Chorus]
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
[Verse 2]
We can't get the timing
Because I was running
But now I want you and you always knew
So baby, you pull away and make me wait for you
So screw all that love -ish
I think that I've had it
The more you turn your back, then I want you back
'Cause this is the last time I play this game
Always the same and I'm through
[Pre-Chorus]
Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think we could be a thing
I gave you everything, love
[Chorus]
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
[Bridge]
Sometimes
'Cause love feels like loneliness sometimes
[Chorus]
Love feels like loneliness (Sometimes)
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, sometimes (Na-na-na-na-na, no, no, no, no)
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
Thumbs=
[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the world
There is a father and a mother
And the father is a son who has a mother
The mother has a daughter
Who gets married to the brother of a mother
And they all just tryna multiply with one another
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends 'til the end, then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
[Verse 2]
Somewhere in the world
They think they're working for themselves
They get up every day to go to work for someone else
And somebody works for them
And so they think they've got it made
But they're all just working to get paid the very same
[Chorus]
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Dum, dum, dum, dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Dum, dum, dum, dum)
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Skiddly-dee-dat-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Dum, dum, dum)
[Verse 3]
Somewhere in the world
You got a robber and a bank
And the bank robbed the people
So the people rob the bank
And the police came to get him, but they let him get away
'Cause they're all just working to get paid the very same
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends 'til the end, and then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
[Chorus]
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Skiddly-dee-dat-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Dum, dum, dum, dum)
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Skiddly-dee-dat-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Dum, dum, dum)
[Bridge]
Don't believe everything that you hear
Let it go through your left and right ear
Don't just march to the beat of that drum
Don't be one of them people just twiddlin' them thumbs
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that's just the way of the world (Way of the world)
It never ends 'til the end, and then you start again (Start again)
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
[Chorus]
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (Keep on)
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Skiddly-dee-dat-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Woo, woo, dum, dum, dum)
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (Keep on, keep on)
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Skiddly-dee-dat-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (Laa)
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum
(Skiddly-dee-dat-dat-dat-de-dat-dum-dum)
[Outro]
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (Keep on, keep on)
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Dum, dum, dum, dum)
They keep on, they keep on
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum
'Cause that's just the way of the world
No Words=
[Intro]
No words, no words, no words
[Verse 1]
When everything is quiet
Nothing on the tip of your tongue
But a beautiful silence
And it lets me know
That even in the madness
When everything just seems to go wrong
Take a beautiful silence
'Cause it lets me know
[Pre-Chorus]
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
[Chorus]
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
(No, no, no words)
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
(No, no, no words)
[Verse 2]
When I'm in the darkness
The dawn is having you by my side
'Cause you leave me speechless
And it lets me know
Where nobody can hear us
I'll tell you everything with my eyes
'Cause you leave me speechless
And I think you know
[Chorus]
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
(No, no, no words)
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
(No, no, no words)
[Bridge]
No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words
No words, no
[Instrumental Interlude]
No, no, no
No words
No, no
[Chorus]
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
(No, no, no words)
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue (tip of your tongue)
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
(No, no, no words)
[Bridge]
No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words
[Pre-Chorus]
(No words, no words, no words)
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
(No words, no words, no words)
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
(No, no, no words)
(No words, no words, no words)
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart (beatin' in the bars, no)
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
(No words, no words, no words)
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
(No, no, no words)
[Outro]
Baby, no words, no words, no words
Run and Hide=
[Verse 1]
I don't wanna buy what they're sellin' these days
Sayin' feelin' and fallin' is all a mistake
No, no
And why does everybody look at young hearts feeling love
Like it's just a matter of time before they break?
No, no
[Pre-Chorus]
They started sayin', "When you can't hide, run"
"When you can't run, hide"
Started thinkin' love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all start thinkin' that the world
Stop spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meanin' it was worth the while?
[Chorus]
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide
[Verse 2]
Traded out our eyes to light a screen
Traded out holdin' hands to holdin' back everything
No, no
No, no, oh
And words got shorter and quiet got longer
And all of a sudden, love started lookin' like a memory
No, no, no
[Pre-Chorus]
They started sayin', "If you can't hide, run"
"If you can't run, hide"
Started thinkin' love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all start thinkin' that the world
Stop spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meanin' it was worth the while?
[Chorus]
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide, no
[Breakdown]
They started sayin', "When you can't hide, run"
"When you can't run, hide"
But love don't gotta be a loaded gun
Or a losin' fight
And when did we all start thinkin' that the world
Stop spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meanin' it was worth the while?
[Chorus]
But I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide
[Outro]
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide
Mirage=
[Verse 1]
They said, "You can't wear Giamba
Baby, you gotta pay"
Well then, we got a problem, problem
"And there's a party at midnight at the top of the hill
But you gotta be someone, someone"
[Pre-Chorus]
And every face is a hologram
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent
It's all part of the scene, oh
[Chorus]
Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?
[Verse 2]
And we just go through the motions
Yeah, we lock 'em inside
Don't show any emotion, emotion
And everybody's been talking
Believe it or not
But you don't gotta listen, listen
[Pre-Chorus]
And every face is a hologram (Hologram)
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent (So innocent)
It's all part of the scene, oh
[Chorus]
Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?
[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
Is it real, is it real or not?
Is it real, everything we've got?
I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
And is it real, is it real or not?
Is it real, everything we've got? Ooh
[Chorus]
Or is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?
[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
Is it just a mirage?
Don't Want It Back=
[Verse 1]
You are the voice inside my mind
Something so real is hard to find
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I'll hold you tight, remove the air
No space between, I want you here
I know, I know (I know, I know)
Baby, you're home
[Pre-Chorus]
Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time
We're livin' for tonight...
[Chorus]
You give me a reason to feel what I feel
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer to all of my fears
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
You got my heart, I don't want it back
[Verse 2]
This moment can't be washed away
A part of you's a part of me
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I know, I know (I know, I know)
This love we have will never end
We're circles, we begin again
I know, I know
Baby, I'm home
[Pre-Chorus]
Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time, no
We're livin' for tonight
[Chorus]
You give me a reason (Ooh, no) to feel what I feel (No, no)
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer to all of my fears (No, no)
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
You got my heart, I don't want it back
[Bridge]
You give me a reason (Huh)
You give me a feeling (Uh-huh-a)
But all of the things you've given to me
You've given to me, baby...
[Outro]
You give me a reason to (No, no) feel what I feel
When everything is under attack (Oh, no)
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer (Oh no, no) to all of my fears (Oh)
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
Don't want it back, no, baby
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
You got my heart, I don't want it back
Shadows=
[Verse 1]
We all got nightmares in our dreams
We look for someone to believe in us and show us the way
And make it okay
The world can be dangerous
There's something so rare in your veins
Not a single thing I would change
And, oh, if you only knew how I see you
Would you come alive again, alive again?
[Pre-Chorus]
I, I
I need you to understand
[Chorus]
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
I don't mind your shadows, your shadows
Baby, I don't
[Verse 2]
Pictures in our head of what we're supposed to be
Measuring ourselves, but where is the love?
Where is the love?
The world got us wonderin', wonderin'
[Pre-Chorus]
I, I
I need you to understand
[Chorus]
That I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows, your shadows
Baby, I don't
[Bridge]
And all these voices in our head
Well, they keep screamin' louder and louder
But they won't pull us under
[Chorus]
And, baby, I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows, your shadows
Baby, I don't
Space=
[Verse 1]
Under pressure (Pressure)
Questions all around, but there's no answers (Answers)
Try to keep my pace, they want it faster (Faster)
Records all around, they give me shelter, shelter (Shelter, shelter)
[Pre-Chorus]
No need to hurry, no need to rush
I tell them my story, it's never enough
(It's never enough)
[Chorus]
I'm hiding from my shadows
Running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom
I need some room to breathe
But I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
[Refrain]
So gimme a little, gimme a little, a little more space
Just gimme a little, gimme a little (More)

Satisfaction (Satisfaction)
All we ever want, but I can't have it (Have it)
Scribbles on the page, they call it magic (Magic)
Makes me wanna be what you imagine, imagine

No need to hurry (No need to hurry)
No need to rush (No need to rush)
I tell them my story, it's never enough

All We Have Is Love=
[Verse 1]
They could tear this house down brick by brick
But we won't even miss a thing
They said we'd never make it, but our hearts won't quit
A never ending fantasy
[Pre-Chorus]
We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down
[Chorus]
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love (na-ah)
[Refrain]
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love (na-ah)
[Verse 2]
We don't need a dream to be wide awake
When everyday is ecstasy
We won't let the stars-crossed change our fate
It's heaven when you're next to me (next to me, next to me)
[Pre-Chorus]
We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down

All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love (na-ah)
[Refrain]
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love (na-ah)

They said we'd never make it, but our hearts won't quit
A never ending fantasy

All we have is love (na-ah)
