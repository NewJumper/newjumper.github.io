In My Bed=
[Verse 1]
Little things become everything
When you wouldn't think that they would
Little things weigh so heavily
Take my energy ’til it's gone
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be alone
But all these emotions won't leave me alone
I’m tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to stop the
Losing all control
Hypothetically, I could let it go easy
[Chorus]
But I'm still, I'm still
I’m still, I’m still, I'm still in my bed about it
I’m still, I'm still, I'm still in my head about it
I'm not usually like this
I’m not usually like this
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed
[Verse 2]
Turn this pillowcase to the cooler side
Give me something I can feel 'cause I
Wanna turn a page, wanna rearrange
Swinging doors wide open in my mind, no
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be alone (Wanna be alone)
But all these emotions won't leave me alone (Won't leave me alone)
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to stop the
Losing all control (All control)
But hypothetically, I could let it go easy
[Chorus]
But I'm still, I'm still
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it (Bed about it)
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my head about it (Head about it)
I'm not usually like this
I'm not usually like this
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it
[Post-Chorus]
(Bed about it, bed about it)
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it
(Bed about it, bed about it)
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it
[Bridge]
Something chemical inside me messin' with my mind
And I can't help but feel like
I'm feeling like someone else (Someone else)
Something animal inside me
Trying to remind me there's no need
To worry about it and lose myself
[Chorus]
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it (Bed about it)
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my head about it (Ah)
I'm not usually like this (I'm not usually like)
I'm not usually like this (I'm not usually like)
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it
[Outro]
I'm still in my bed, I'm still in my bed (Oh yeah)
(Bed about it, bed about it)
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed about it (Oh yeah, yeah)
I'm still in my bed, I'm still in my (Bed about it, bed about it)
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still in my bed
Pushing 20=
[Verse 1]
What, what, what, whatcha say, Mr. Clean?
I'm flagging you down for a misdemeanor
It must look different from your mezzanine
You got me, got me feeling out of touch, Hall & Oates
Push it out, wish me luck

Out of yours in my controlla
[Chorus]
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (Pushing, pushing)

I'm pushing 20, I ain't talking 'bout a Bimmer
And while you're wasting time, the money's in the meter
So I can start from scratch, make you a believer
Or I can just, da-da-da
Act like I don't give a, uh
[Pre-Chorus]
You got a way, you're messing with my faith
You're tryna paint a picture, but you're running out of paint

I'm Fakin=
[Verse 1]
We're picking fights, we're fully grown
How come we get so immature when we're alone?
I roll my eyes, you check your phone
You say I'm overly dramatic and I know
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna bring you to your knees
Begging for me now, begging for me
Push you to the edge to see
How far you're willing to reach
[Chorus]
I'm slamming the door, but I'm staying
I make up my mind and I change it
It's you that I want when we're breaking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
I'm losing the game that I'm playing
Keep pulling me close 'cause I'm fading
Don't forget the words that I'm saying
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
[Post-Chorus]
(La, ra-ra-ra-ra) I'm faking
(La, ra-ra-ra-ra) I'm faking, oh
(La, ra-ra-ra-ra) I'm faking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
[Verse 2]
We go ego to ego, starting fires
Saying shit we don't mean, I mean we're liars
But the truth is we're messed up and we like it
Shut up, shut up, shut up
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna bring you to your knees
Begging for me now, begging for me
Push you to the edge to see
How far you're willing to reach, yeah

Take Off All Your Cool=

If you let me take a picture of your bad side (Bad side)
And you like it, well, that's a good sign, hey (Yep)
I know you're not a fan of double texting (Texting)
But you don't always gotta leave me guessing (Guessing)
I know you wanna leave a good impression
But you did it, you did without tryin', oh yeah

And we don't need opinions in our head space
You and me already in a good place

Exhale=
[Verse 1]
Who put the baby in charge?
It's already hard to buy all the parts and learn to use them
Who put the world on my back and not in my hands?
Just give me a chance
[Pre-Chorus]
Listen to my mama, listen to my dad
Listen to my sisters, everyone relax
Everybody answers shit I didn't ask
Think I'm reaching my limit
[Chorus]
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can I get this out in the open?
Can I sit down for a second?
Can I breathe?
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can we talk it out? I don't get it
Can I calm down for a moment?
Can I breathe for just one second?
[Verse 2]
I put too much weight on words and glances
I, I put too much weight on situations
I, I put too much on myself
Thinking I don't deserve what I've earned, but yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I listen to the labels, listen to the man
Try to keep a sense of knowing who I am
I try to be an angel, but I don't think I can
Think I'm reaching my limits, yeah
[Chorus]
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can I get this out in the open?
Can I sit down for a second?
Can I breathe?
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can we talk it out? I don't get it
Can I calm down for a moment?
Can I breathe for just one second, baby?
[Bridge]

Take You Back=
[Verse 1]
I picked you out 'cause you were shiny and new
Had all the features, even came with tattoos
[Pre-Chorus]
But I just figured out now what hindsight means
Up until now, never had any reason to
Wish that I didn't, but now I do
The hell do I do with all these receipts?
Every moment that I ever spent on you
Shoulda just bought a new pair of shoes
[Chorus]
(Eh, eh, eh)
I wanna take you back, take you back, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you

Closest I've ever come to buyer's remorse
If you don't make me happy, then what good are you for?
[Pre-Chorus]
But I just figured out now what hindsight means
Up until now, never had any reason to
Wish that I didn't, but now I do
The hell do I do with all these receipts?
Every moment that I ever spent on you
Shoulda just bought a new pair of shoes
[Chorus]
(Eh, eh, eh)
I wanna take you back, take you back, oh

If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, say it again (Rid of it, rid of it, na)

If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, rid of it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, say it again
[Chorus]

[Intro]
Oh
Oh, yeah

Did I catch your attention?
You look like you lost your breath, huh
When I circle the room, you an owl, you gon' twist your head
Don't you come at me green with an attitude
When my lips and my soles are red
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks
No, no

Never worry 'bout the eyes (Come on)

It could be you and me, but you know that I'll steal the show
