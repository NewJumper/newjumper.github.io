Good Day=
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I can feel my saturation
Leaving me slowly
Broke the news on Mom's vacation
Oh, but you know me
[Chorus]
Low-key, I'm alright
Would you say you depend on the weather?
My sunshine
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out
I know it's hard to believe me, it's a good day
[Verse 2]
Lost my job, my wife and child
Homie just sued me
Shoot my life in shoot-'em-up style
Her favorite movies
[Chorus]
Low-key, I'm alright
Would you say you depend on the weather?
My sunshine
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out
I know it's hard to believe me, it's a good day
[Bridge]
Today's a good day, never know, never know
When the next one will show, it'll show
So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul (Da-da-da)
Today's a good day, never know, never know
When the next one will show, it'll show
So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul, yeah
(So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul)
[Chorus]
I'm alright
Would you say you depend on the weather?
My sunshine
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out
I know it's hard to believe me, it's a good day
[Outro]
I'm alright
I'm alright
I think that I'm alright
It's a good day
Choker=
[Intro]
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
[Verse 1]
I don't bother anyone
Nervous when I stand
Chokin' on the circumstance
Only smokin' secondhand (Mm-mm)
Cut us open, spread us out (Mm-mm)
Dry us in the sand (Mm-mm)
Lay the fibers side by side (Mm-mm)
And you'll begin to understand (Mm-mm)
[Chorus]
I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's comin' for me
Comin' for me
[Post-Chorus]
Mm-mm (I know it's over)
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
[Verse 2]
I don't bother anyone
Never make demands
Chokin' on the circumstance
Self-sabotage is a sweet romance (Mm-mm)
Seems like all I'm worth is what I'm able to withstand (Mm-mm)
Sooner I can realize that pain is just a middleman
[Chorus]
I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's comin' for me
[Bridge]
I see no volunteers to co-sign on my fears
I'll sign on the line
Alone, I'm gonna change my circumstance
I know I need to move right now
[Chorus]
'Cause I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's comin' for me (Only smokin' secondhand)
I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's comin' for me
Comin' for me
[Verse 3]
Like a little splinter buried in your skin
Someone else can carve it out but when you've got the pin
It hurts a little less and you can even push it further in
When your body's screamin' out, trust your mind's listenin'
Like a silhouette that you can barely see
As a shadow cast upon the ground where you'll eventually
Lay forever, but the day goes on, the sun moves behind you
You get taller, bolder, stronger, and the rearview only blinds you
[Outro]
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Shy Away=
[Verse 1]
When I get home
You better not be there
We're placin' bets you won't
[Pre-Chorus]
Shed your modesty
And the only thing to leave behind
Is your own skin on the floor
[Chorus]
Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Manifest a ceiling
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Searchin' for that feelin'
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)
Like a song he wrote that's never heard (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't you sh…
[Verse 2]
When you get home
You barely recognize the pictures
They put in a frame
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you shed your modеsty
Don't circle the track
Take what you havе
And leave your skin on the floor
[Chorus]
Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Manifest a ceiling
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Searchin' for that feelin'
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)
Like a song he wrote (Ah-ah-ah)
That's never heard
[Verse 3]
When I get home
Boy, you better not be there
You're long gone
[Pre-Chorus]
Shed your modesty
Don't circle the track
Just break the cycle in half
And leave your skin on the floor
[Chorus]
Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Manifest a ceiling
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Searchin' for that feelin'
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)
Like a song he wrote (Ah-ah-ah)
That's never heard
That's never heard (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
[Outro]
An "I love you"
That isn't words
Like a song he wrote
That's never heard
Don't you shy away
The Outside=
[Verse 1]
I'm already bored
I'm pretty sure I've seen this one before
I've got a long drive, I'll tape my eyes
So I don't fall asleep again
Singin' out
[Chorus]
Up and down, they're nodding
Heads are moving up and down, you got it
Everybody stand in line (Up and down, you got it)
One by one, take a hit, join the club
Kids will try to take my vibes
Or am I on the outside? (Am I on the outside?)
[Verse 2]
I've got a long drive, I'll tape my eyes
So I don't fall asleep again (Ooh-oh)
Singin' out
[Chorus]
Up and down, they're nodding
Heads are moving up and down, you got it
Everybody stand in line (Up and down, you got it)
One by one, take a hit, join the club
Kids will try to take my vibes (Up and down, you got it)
Or am I on the outside?
[Interlude]
Am I on the outside?
Am I on the outside?
[Bridge]
I am a Megalodon, ocean's feelin' like a pond (Like a pond)
Swimmin' like a beast, underneath, they be clingin' on (Clingin' on)
Meteoric rise in prehistoric times
Now that meteor is comin', comin'
I am Megatron, cogs I'm steppin' on (Steppin' on)
Then the little cogs get together, start a renaissance (A renaissance)
Switch it up on me, fuel efficiency
On fumes, I am runnin', runnin', runnin'
[Chorus]
Up and down, they're nodding
Heads are moving up and down, you got it
Everybody up and down, they're nodding
Heads are moving up and down, you got it
Everybody stand in line (Up and down, you got it)
One by one, take a hit, join the club
Kids will try to take my vibes (Up and down, you got it)
Or am I on the outside?
[Outro]
In the summer heat, in the summer heat
I'm in the street, I'm in the street
I'm on the outside
In the summer heat (In the summer heat)
You can pay the cover charge
I'm in the street (I'm in the street)
Little did they know
That they can't touch me (Touch me)
I'm vibing, vibing
I'm on the outside
In the summer heat (In the summer heat)
You can pay the cover charge
I'm in the street (I'm in the street)
Little did they know
That they can't touch me (Touch me)
I'm vibing, vibing, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Saturday=
[Chorus]
Slow down on Monday
Not a sound on Wednesday, yeah
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town
[Verse 1]
Lose my sense a time or two
Weeks feel like days
Medicate in the afternoon
And I just want to know;
Have you lost your footing, too?
I just pray that I'm not losing you
[Pre-Chorus]
Catch me floatin' circles in my fishbowl
Keep things fresh
She said that I should change my clothes
I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Slow down on Monday
Not a sound on Wednesday, yeah
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town
[Bridge]
Ooh, you're good
These are my dancin' shoes
We paint the town
Ooh, you're good
Thought I would dance with you
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town
[Verse 2]
(Feelin' great)
Life moves slow on the ocean floor
(Feelin' great)
I can't feel the waves anymore
Did the tide forget to move?
I just pray that I'm not losin' you
[Pre-Chorus]
Catch me floatin' circles in my fishbowl
Keep things fresh
She said that I should change my clothes
I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, yeah
[Interlude: Tyler Joseph & Jenna Joseph]
Workin' on music?
Yeah
I-I'll just go to bed, I'm tired
I wanna watch 'Friends' with you
Oh, if you feel like you have time to do a song or you're inspired
You should just go for it (Oh)
[Chorus]
Slow down on Monday (Yeah, yeah)
Not a sound on Wednesday
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town
[Outro]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
We paint the, on
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

[Verse 1]
Now that they know information (Information)
Is just a currency and nothing more
Keep the truth in quotations (In quotations)
'Cause they keep lying through their fake teeth
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, they're trying hard to weaponize
You and I, we'll never take it
Oh-oh-oh, they're asking for a second try
You and I will never take it
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Why cure disease of confusion (Of confusion)
When you're the treatment facility?
How can we seek restitution (Restitution)
When they keep lying through their fake teeth?
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, they're trying hard to weaponize
You and I, we'll nеver take it
Oh-oh-oh, they'rе asking for a second try
You and I will never take it (Yeah, ah-ah-ah)
Will never take it
Oh-oh-oh, they're asking for a second try
You and I will never take it from 'em
[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh)
The summer I watched the tube, I saw enough
Taught myself to play guitar, tearing it up
And my advice on those two things that I picked up
You better educate yourself, but never too much
The summer I watched the tube (Ooh-ooh), I saw enough (I saw enough)
Taught myself to play guitar (Ooh-ooh), tearing it up (Tearing it up)
And my advice on those two things (Ooh-ooh) that I picked up (I picked up)
You better educate yourself (Ooh), but never too much (Never too much)
[Chorus]
(Weaponize, you and I)
Never take it, oh-oh-oh
They profit from a great divide
You and I will never take it
[Guitar Solo]

Mulberry Street=

One, two, three, yeah
Ah, ah
Keep your bliss, there's nothing wrong with this, no (Wrong with this, no)
Ah-ah-ah-ah, yeah, whoo-ooh
Keep your bliss, there's nothing wrong with this, no (Wrong with this, no)
[Verse 1]
Keep your sunny days, leave us in the rain
Tie strings to our hands and feet to rain on your parade
You can have the weekends, we will live between them
Keep your pills, save your breath, and don't ever forget
[Chorus]
Get out of our way, we're moving sideways
Welcome to Mulberry Street, yeah
So move out of our way, we're pushing sideways
Keep sidewalk under your feet
[Verse 2]
Ain't no sunny skies 'til you finally realize
That evеrybody relies on synthetic highs (Synthеtic highs)
They find someone to prescribe
Keep your bliss, there's nothing wrong with this
We just want to feel it all
Keep your pills, save your breath, and don't ever forget
[Chorus]
Get out of our way, we're moving sideways
Welcome to Mulberry Street, yeah
So move out of our way, we're pushing sideways
Keep sidewalk under your feet
(Ain't no sunny skies…)
[Bridge]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
When times aren't the best and I'm on the edge
I'll listen for a song in the distance
Mulberry Street, so good to see you
Mulberry Street, so good to see you
Mulberry Street, so good to see you
Mulberry Street
And don't ever forget
[Chorus]
Get out of our way, we're moving sideways
Welcome to Mulberry Street, yeah
So move out of our way, we're pushing sideways (Sideways)
Keep sidewalk under your feet (Yeah, ooh) (Keep your sunny days)
Get out of our way, we're moving sideways (We're moving sideways)
Welcome to Mulberry Street (Yeah, so good to see you)
So move out of our way (So good, so good), we're pushing sideways
Keep sidewalk under your feet (Mulberry Street, so good to see you)
[Outro]
Keep your bliss, there's nothing wrong with this, no
Formidable=
[Chorus]
You are formidable to me
'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you
But you should know I might be cynical towards you
But I just can't believe that I'm for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know
(Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 1]
And I know that we just met
But could you take me everywhere you've ever been?
I wanna see it all, no surprises
Yeah
[Chorus]
You are formidable to me
'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go
Yeah, yeah, yеah, I'll follow you
But you should know I might be clinical, don't you tell
I won't break your hеart if you can break my spell
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know
[Verse 2]
Fast-forward thirteen years now
Don't know what it was, but somehow, we played it out in reverse
I'm afraid of you now, more than I was at first
And I know you just left
But can I take you everywhere we've ever been?
I wanna see it all, no surprises, yeah
[Chorus]
You are formidable to me
'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you
But you should know I might be cynical towards you
I'm just worried my loyalty will bore you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know
Bounce Man=
[Intro]
You should bounce, bounce, bounce, man
Come to the house, man, I'll let my old lady know
You'll be in and out, out, out, man
Float you a couple bands, then you head to Mexico
Haha
I'll let my old lady know
What'd you do, man?
My friend, yeah, yeah (Then you head to Mexico)
[Verse 1]
I don't know if you've got your phone
'Cause this went straight to voicemail
And my wife saw your face on the nightly news
Oh boy, what'd you do?
Don't matter now
If you need a piece, I'll break it down (Break it down)
[Chorus]
You should bounce, bounce, bounce, man
Come to the house, man, I'll let my old lady know
You'll be in and out, out, out, man

Before you bounce, bounce, bounce, man
Come to the house, man, we'll sing one more song
So long
[Post-Chorus]
I'll let my old lady know, so long
Then you head to Mexico
[Verse 2]
If they come knockin' (Pop, pop, pop)
Ain't no stoppin' me for you
Just let me know you're good on your amenities
Got soldiers on my pedigree
If you don't reply (If you don't reply)
I'll know you must have crossed state lines
She's been cryin', but I'll tell her you're fine
Don't matter now
If you need a piece, I'll break it down (Break it down)
[Chorus]
You should bounce, bounce, bounce, man
Come to the house, man, I'll let my old lady know

Yeah, I told you all along (Da-da-da, ba-da-da-da)
Runnin' away don't make you wrong
Before you bounce, bounce, bounce, man (Da-da-da, ba-da-da-da)
Come to the house, man, we'll sing one more song
So long
No Chances=
[Refrain]
We come for you, no chances
We come for you, no chances
[Verse 1]
(Mm)
In my house shoes in a foot race
In this house, we got feng shui
Get the door to blow you away
Flamethrower, you a switchblade
Feet planted on grip tape
With my shoulders squared and my back straight
Got a good base and a loose tongue
Notorious in the octagon, now
[Chorus]
Mm, ba-da-dum, ba-da-dum-bum
We got people on the way
We want you home in one piece now (Run away, run away)
Mm, ba-da-dum, ba-da-dum-bum
We get bodies every day
We want you home in one piece now
[Refrain]
We come for you, no chances
We come for you, no chances
[Verse 2]
How'd you get the location? Put together pieces?
They say they sell the information
In those terms of agreement
We spent some weekends on the grind
Surveillances outside, we see when you arrive
Ride or die, my son
Spent some weekends on the grind
Surveillances outside, we see when you arrive
Ride or die, my son
[Chorus]
Mm, ba-da-dum, ba-da-dum-bum
We got people on the way
We want you home in one piece now (Run away, run away)
Mm, ba-da-dum, ba-da-dum-bum
We get bodies every day
We want you home in one piece now (Run away, run away)
Mm, ba-da-dum, ba-da-dum-bum
Mm, ba-da-dum, ba-da-dum-bum
We got people on the way
We want you home in one piece now (Run away, run away)
Mm, ba-da-dum, ba-da-dum-bum
We get bodies every day
We want you home in one piece now
[Refrain]
We come for you, no chances
We come for you, no chances
[Outro]
We-we-we
Mm-mm-mm, yeah
Mm-mm, yeah
Mm-mm-mm, yeah

We spent some weekends on the grind
Surveillances outside, we see when you arrive
Ride or die, my son
Spent some weekends on the grind
Surveillances outside, we see when you arrive
Ride or die, my son
Redecorate=
[Intro]
There was a wonderful structure to the city
And it put my cares to rest
(Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Verse 1]
Takin' inventory of his life
Seein' snapshots chronologically in line
Something told him he should look around and tidy up
He collected many things but never quite enough
Tried lookin' at it from a new perspective
Flat on his back but he still heard the directive
Orders from that corner where that shadow always lived
Never asked permission, he just hopes that they forgive
[Chorus]
I don't want to go like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
At least let me clean my room
I don't want to leave like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause the last thing I want to do is
Make my people make decisions, wonderin' what to do, oh
Should they keep it on display
Or redecorate?
[Verse 2]
Blankets over mirrors, she tends to like it
She's not afraid of her reflection
But of what she might see behind it
She had plans to change her name (Yeah)
Just not the traditional way (Yeah)
Haunted by a couple big mistakes
She covers all the dents with the way she decorates
Then one night, she got cold with no blankets on her bed
So she ripped them off the mirror, stepped back and she said
[Chorus]
I don't want to go like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
At least let me clean my room
I don't want to leave like this (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause the last thing I want to do is
Make my people make decisions, wonderin' what to do, oh
Should they keep it on display
Or redecorate?
[Bridge]
With the bells and the whistles scaled back
Like an isolated track
And he feels trapped when he's not inebriated
Fair to say he's fairly sedated most days of the week
He might have made it if he lived on a different street
I repeat, scaled back and isolated
He says he likes an open schedule, but he mostly hates it
If you're running to his room, take a breath before you break in
Put your ear up to the door, tell me, can you hear him saying?
[Chorus]
I don't want to go like this
At least let me clean my room
I don't want to leave like this
'Cause the last thing I want to do is
Make my people make decisions, wondering what to do, oh
Should they keep it on display
Or redecorate?
I don't want to go like this (Go like this)
At least let me clean my room
I don't want to leave like this (Leave like this)
'Cause the last thing I want to do is
Make my people make decisions, wondering what to do, oh
Should they keep it on display
Or redecorate?
[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Or redecorate?
(Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Or redecorate?
