Heavydirtysoul=
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke
'Cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean
[Pre-Chorus]
Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm (I'm)
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm (I'm)
[Chorus]
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me (Uh)
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me (Uh)
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
[Verse 2]
Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walkin' around with a limp and a hunch
Sayin' stuff like, "You only live once"
You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talkin' about
[Pre-Chorus]
Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm (I'm)
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm (I'm)
[Chorus]
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me (Uh)
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me (Uh)
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
[Bridge]
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
[Chorus]
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me (Uh)
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me (Uh)
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
[Outro]
Can you save, can you save my, save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my, save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Stressed Out=
[Verse 1]
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter
[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[Bridge]
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money," yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money," yeah
[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[Outro]
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money," yeah
Ride=
[Verse 1]
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize
[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride
[Verse 2]
"I'd die for you," that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
"I'd live for you," and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like "Who would you live for?" "Who would you die for?"
And "Would you ever kill?"
[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride
[Bridge]
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time
Takin' my time on my ride, woah-oh-oh (Woah, yeah)
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my—
[Outro]
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
Fairly Local=
[Chorus]
Ah, I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
I'm evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional, what I wanna save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am? I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat and repeat yesterday's dance
[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin', but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
[Chorus]
Ah, I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
I'm not evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will fight
I know I'm emotional, what I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am, I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat to avoid yesterday's dance
[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin', but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Ah, I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets (I've seen the streets) you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah)
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, good people now
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, good people now
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tear in My Heart=
[Intro]
An-nyŏng-ha-se-yo
[Verse 1]
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you're alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around to show you how
[Chorus]
She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher
Than I've ever been
[Verse 2]
The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
And it takes a song to come around to show you how
[Chorus]
She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
[Bridge]
You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time
But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government
For not usin' my taxes to fill holes with more cement
You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time
But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know, oh, oh
That you're alive and have a soul, oh, oh
But it takes someone to come around to show you how
[Chorus]
She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher
Than I've ever been
[Outro]
My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Oh, than I've ever been
My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther
Than I've ever been
Lane Boy=
[Chorus]
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
[Verse 1]
They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry, it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows
[Chorus]
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)
[Verse 2]
I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
[Chorus]
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
[Bridge]
(But will they be alive tomorrow?)
(But will they be alive tomorrow?)
(But will they be alive tomorrow?)
They be alive tomorrow?
[Drum Solo]
[Chorus]
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
[Instrumental Outro]
The Judge=
[Intro]
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
When the leader of the bad guys sang
Something soft and soaked in pain
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He must've forgot to close his door
As he cranked out those dismal chords
And his four walls declared him insane
[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way, right time, wrong place
As I pled my case
[Chorus]
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason
So please, take me
[Refrain]
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Three lights are lit, but the fourth one's out
I can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought of light bulbs in this house
So I head out down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out and now I hear it clear and loud
I'm thinking "Wow, I probably should've stayed inside my house"
[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way, right time, wrong place
As I pled my case
[Chorus]
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason
So please
[Bridge]
I don't know if this song
Is a surrender or a revel
I don't know if this one
Is about me or the devil
I don't know if this song
Is a surrender or a revel
I don't know if this one
Is about me or the devil
[Interlude]
(Woah, oh-oh)
Oh! (Yeah)
(Woah, oh-oh)
[Chorus]
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free, oh no
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free, oh no
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason (Oh)
So please (Ooh-ooh)
[Refrain]
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na, oh, oh
[Chorus]
You're the judge, oh no (Na-na-na-na, oh, oh)
Set me free (Na-na-na-na, oh, oh)
You're the judge, oh no (Na-na-na-na, oh, oh)
Set me free (Na-na-na-na, oh, oh)
You're the judge, oh no (Na-na-na-na, oh, oh)
Set me free (Na-na-na-na, oh, oh; Oh, Josh Dun!)
You're the judge, oh no (Na-na-na-na, oh, oh)
Set me free (Na-na-na-na, oh, oh)
Doubt=
[Verse 1]
Scared of my own image, scared of my own immaturity
Scared of my own ceiling, scared I'll die of uncertainty
Fear might be the death of me, fear leads to anxiety
Don't know what's inside of me
[Chorus]
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Even when I doubt you (Doubt you)
I'm no good without you, no, no
[Verse 2]
Temperature is dropping, temperature is dropping
I'm not sure if I can see this ever stopping
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no
You are all that I've got, no
[Chorus]
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Even when I doubt you (Doubt you)
I'm no good without you, no, no, no, no, no
[Bridge]
Gnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system
Repeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted
Want the markings made on my skin
To mean something to me again
Hope you haven't left without me
Hope you haven't left without me, please
[Chorus]
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Even when I doubt you (Doubt you)
I'm no good without you, no
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Even when I doubt you
No good without you, no, no, no, no
[Outro]
Hey! Hey! (Don't forget about me, no) No, no, no, no
Hey! Hey! (Don't forget about me, no) No, no, no, no
Hey! Hey! (Don't forget about me, no)
Hey! Hey! (Don't forget about me, no)
Polarize=
[Chorus]
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hidin' all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems
[Verse 1]
You know where I'm coming from
Though I am running to you
All I feel is deny, deny, denial
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But deny, deny, denial
[Chorus]
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hidin' all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems
[Verse 2]
Polarize is taking your disguises
Separating 'em, splitting 'em up from wrong and right
It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight
Deny, deny, denial
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But deny, deny, denial
[Chorus]
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hidin' all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems
[Refrain]
Ah-da-da, da-da, da-da da-da
Ah-da-da, da-da, we have problems
Ah-da-da, da-da, da-da da-da
Ah-da-da, da-da, we have problems

Domingo en fuego
I think I lost my halo

Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I have problems, yeah
(We have problems)
Singing out, we're singing out, we're singing out
(We have problems)
Yeah
[Outro]
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
We Don't Believe What's on TV=
[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[Verse 1]
We don't believe what's on TV
Because it's what we want to see
And what we want we know we can't believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams
[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know
That when I fail, you'll still be here, mm
'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair
[Chorus]
I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say, "I wanna die before I'm old"
But because of you, I might think twice
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[Interlude]
Alright, second verse
[Verse 2]
What if my dream does not happen?
Would I just change what I've told my friends?
Don't want to know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep
[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know
That when I fail, you'll still be here, oh
'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair
[Chorus]
But I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you, I might think twice
I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you, I might think twice

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
No, no, no, no, no, no (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
[Verse 1]
A loser hides behind
A mask of my disguise
And who I am today
Is worse than other times
You don't know what I've done
I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm takin' this moment to live in the future
[Chorus]
Release me from the present, I'm obsessin', all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message, man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand
[Refrain]

You don't know my brain
The way you know my name
You don't know my heart
The way you know my face
You don't know what I've done
I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm takin' this moment to live in the future
[Chorus]
Release me from the present, I'm obsessin', all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Hope you're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
People, they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line
It's just poetry divided, I'm the kind of guy
Who takes every moment he knows he confided in
Music to use it for others to use it
You're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
Life is up here but you comment below
And the comments will always become common
Motivation to promote your show's next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment
But you and I know it gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together we're losers, remember the future
Remember the morning is when night is dead
[Chorus]
Release me from the present, I'm obsessin', all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message, man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message, man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand

Hometown=
[Refrain]
My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly
[Verse 1]
Be the one, be the one to take my soul and make it undone
Be the one, be the one to take me home and show me the sun
I know, I know you can bring the fire, I can bring the bones
I know, I know you'll make the fire, my bones will make it grow
[Chorus]
Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark
[Refrain]
My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly
[Verse 2]
Put away, put away all the gods your father served today
Put away, put away your traditions, believe me when I say
We don't know, we don't know how to put back the power in our soul
We don't know, we don't know where to find what once was in our bones
[Chorus]
Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark
[Refrain]
My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly
[Chorus]
Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark
Not Today=
[Verse 1]
I don't know why I just feel I'm better off
Stayin' in the same room I was born in
I look outside and see a whole world better off
Without me in it tryin' to transform it
[Pre-Chorus]
You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seein' my side, oh
You waste all this time tryin' to get to me
But you are out of my mind
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Listen, I know
This one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds
But the lyrics are so down
It's okay though
Because it represents, wait, better yet, it is
Who I feel I am right now
[Pre-Chorus]
You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seein' my side, oh
You waste all this time tryin' to get to me
But you are out of my mind
[Chorus]
Heard you say, "Not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, "there's no choice"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise
[Bridge]
Oh, don't you test me though
Just because I play the piano
Doesn't mean I am not willin' to take you down
I'm sorry
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm, I'm out of my mind, oh
I'm not seein' things right, oh
I waste all this time tryin' to run from you
But I'm, I'm out of my mind
[Chorus]
Heard you say, "Not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, "there's no choice"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise
[Bridge 2]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, ohh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, ohh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
You are out of my mind
You aren't seein' my side
You waste all this time tryin' to get to me
But you are out of my mind
[Chorus]
Heard you say, "Not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, "there's no choice"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise
[Outro]
Buh buh bah, buh buh bah (Yeah)
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah (Yeah)
(Woah) Buh buh bah, (Yeah) buh buh bah
(No, no) Bah bah bah bah bah, (No, yeah) bah bah bah bah bah
Buh buh bah, buh buh bah (Not today, not today)
Bah bah bah bah bah (Not today), bah bah bah bah bah (Not today)
Buh buh bah (No, not today), buh buh bah (Not today)
(No, no, no, no) Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah (No) bah (No)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Goner=
[Verse 1]
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you
[Chorus]
Though I'm weak and beaten down
I'll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside out, you're underneath
[Verse 2]
I've got two faces, Blurry's the one I'm not
I've got two faces, Blurry's the one I'm not
I need your help to take him out
I need your help to take him out
[Chorus]
Though I'm weak and beaten down
I'll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside out, you're underneath
Though I'm weak and beaten down
I'll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside out, you're underneath
[Bridge]
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be!
Don't let me be!
Oh, yeah!
[Outro]
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you
