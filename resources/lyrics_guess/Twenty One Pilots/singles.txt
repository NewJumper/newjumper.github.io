Christmas Saves The Year=
[Verse 1]
Snow falls down from the gray sky
Ashes fall in the sea
Plans are thrown to the wayside
Frozen days of the week
[Chorus]
But everybody wants to make it home this year
Even if the world is crumblin' down
'Cause everybody's got somebody who's got their name on a shelf
With cheap decor and flavored cheer
You rest assured that Christmas saves the year
[Verse 2]
Dust off old photo boxes
This one's marked '92, yeah
Years past seemed so much grander
This one needs to come through
[Chorus]
'Cause evеrybody wants to make it home this year
Evеn if the world is crumblin' down
'Cause everybody's got somebody who's got their name on a shelf
With cheap décor and flavored cheer
You rest assured that Christmas saves the year
[Bridge]
Bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum
[Chorus]
Everybody wants to make it home this year
Even if the world is crumblin' down
'Cause everybody's got somebody who's got their name on a shelf
With cheap décor and flavored cheer
You rest assured…
[Chorus]
Everybody wants to make it home this year
Even if the world is crumblin' down
'Cause everybody's got somebody who's got their name on a shelf
With cheap décor and flavored cheer
You rest assured, Christmas saves the year
[Outro]
Ho ho ho
Level of Concern=
[Intro]
Need you, tell me
Need you, tell me
[Verse 1]
Panic on the brain, world has gone insane
Things are starting to get heavy, mm
I can't help but think I haven't felt this way
Since I asked you to go steady
[Pre-Chorus]
Wonderin' would you be my little quarantine?
Or is this the way it ends?
[Chorus]
'Cause I told you my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
And you could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
[Verse 2]
Panic on the brain, Michael's gone insane
Julie starts to make me nervous
I don't really care what they would say
I'm asking you to stay
In my bunker underneath the surface
[Pre-Chorus]
Wonderin' would you be (Would you be)
My little quarantine? (Quarantine)
Or is this the way it ends?
[Chorus]
'Cause I told you my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
And you could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah
Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah
[Bridge]
'Cause I told you my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
You could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
I need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
I need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Need you now
I need you now
[Chorus]
'Cause I told you my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
And you could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah
Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
You could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah
[Outro]
In a world where you could just lie to me (Need you)
And I'd be okay, we'll be okay (Level of concern)
We're gonna be okay (Just need you to tell me we're alright)
Tell me we're okay, I need you
Need you, tell me
Need you, tell me
Heathens=
[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day, locked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know  the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget
[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
[Verse 2]
We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You'll never know the freak show sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it, watch it)
[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
[Bridge]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know (Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
[Outro]
Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed (It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away (Wouldn't listen to me)
And now they're outside ready to bust (And guess what?)
It looks like you might be one of us
