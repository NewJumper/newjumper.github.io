Jumpsuit=
[Intro]
Cover me, oh!
[Chorus]
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
I crumble underneath the weight
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
[Verse]
Spirits in my room, friend or foe?
Felt it in my youth, feel it when I'm old
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Dusting off my jumpsuit (Cover me)
[Chorus]
I can't believe how much I hate (Cover me, oh)
Pressures of a new place roll my way (Cover me, oh)
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me (Cover me, oh)
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me (Cover me, oh)
[Bridge]
I'll be right there
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
If you need anyone
I'll stop my plans (I'll stop my plans)
But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands
If you need anyone
I'll be right there (I'll be right there)
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
(If you need anyone)
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)
If you need anyone
[Chorus]
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Oh, jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me, oh!
[Outro]
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
Levitate=
[Chorus]
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
Learn to levitate with just a little help
[Bridge]
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
[Verse]
Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse, now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too, youâ€™re the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place
[Chorus]
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
You can levitate with just a little help
[Outro]
Welcome to Trench
Morph=
[Intro]
Move!
[Verse 1]
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries
For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this
[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
[Verse 2]
He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time, I'll try to sing this
[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else
[Bridge]
Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else
[Outro]
Not done, not done
Not done, Josh Dun
I'll morph to someone else
My Blood=
[Verse 1]
When everyone you thought you knew
Deserts your fight, I'll go with you
You're facin' down a dark hall
I'll grab my light
[Refrain]
And go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
[Verse 2]
Surrounded and up against a wall
I'll shred 'em all and go with you
When choices end, you must defend
I'll grab my bat
[Refrain]
And go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you, yeah
[Chorus]
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
[Verse 3]
If there comes a day
People posted up at the end of your driveway
They're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name
I'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through
Did they know I was grown with you?
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah
[Chorus]
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
[Verse 4]
If you find yourself in a lion's den
I'll jump right in and pull my pin
[Refrain]
And go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
(You don't need to run)
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
(You don't need to run)
I'll go with you
My blood, I'll go with you, yeah
[Chorus]
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
Chlorine=
[Intro: Tyler Joseph, Paul Meany]
So where are ya?
It's been a little while
[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
[Verse 1]
Lovin' what I'm tastin', woah
Venom on my tongue, dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations, woah
Help my body run
[Refrain]
I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
[Verse 2]
Fall out of formation, woah
I plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation, woa-a-oh
Grows while I decay
[Refrain]
I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
[Verse 3]
Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight
And you in my life is like
[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
[Interlude]
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
[Outro]
I'm so sorry I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Smithereens=
[Verse 1]
You know
I've always been collected, calm and chill
And you know
I never look for conflict for the thrill
But if Iâ€™m feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe
Just what I'm feeling
[Chorus]
For you, Iâ€™d go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens
[Verse 2]
You know
I'll be in the corner taking notes
And you know
I got your six while you're working votes
But if I'm feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe
Just what I'm feeling
[Chorus]
For you, I'd go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens
[Bridge]
(Fight fight fight fight fight)
(I would get beat to)
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one on the record (For you)
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her
[Refrain]
If I'm feeling
Someone stepping towards you, canâ€™t describe
Just what Iâ€™m feeling
[Outro]
For you, I'd go
Write a slick song just to show you the world
For you, I know
They think itâ€™s messed up to sell out for your girl
For you, I'd go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens
Neon Gravestones=
[Intro]
Call (Call)
Call (Call)
Call (Call)
[Verse 1]
What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win
And right before we turn on them
We give 'em the highest of praise
And hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way, no
[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call (Call, call, call)
Call (Call)
Call (Call)
[Verse 2]
What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say, "How could he go if he's got everything?
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king"
[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call
[Bridge]
Promise me this (Call, call)
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
Promise me this
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
(Ooh, call, ooh, call)
[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
(Neon gravestones try to call for my bones)
[Bridge]
'Cause they won't get them
No, they won't get them
They won't get them
But they won't get them
[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking "I'll teach them"
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated
The Hype=
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or Iâ€™ll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes
[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know youâ€™re a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
[Verse 2]
Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt
[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
(Take me with you)
[Bridge]
(Weâ€™re gonna rely pretty heavily
On technology
And energy
To cover up the fact that weâ€™re only two people
But I think we can do it)
No, I don't know which way Iâ€™m going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way Iâ€™m going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
But I can hear my way around
[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
(Don't believe the hype)
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

[Chorus]
East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control
East is up
[Verse 1]
They want to make you forget
They want to make you forget
Save your razorblades now, not yet
Save your razorblades now, not yet
[Chorus]
I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady
I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh
I'm so high, my Jumpsuit takes me so high
I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh
East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control
I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady
I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh
I'm so high, my Jumpsuit takes me so high
I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh
[Bridge]
I'm heavy, jumpsuit is on steady
Lighter when I'm lower, higher when I'm heavy, oh
I'm so high, I'm so high
So high, I'm so high
Fire, Nico and the Niners
[Verse 2]
What I say when I want to be enough
What a beautiful day for making a break for it
We'll find a way to pay for it
Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores
Rent a racehorse and force a sponsor
And start a concert, a complete diversion
Start a mob and you can be quite certain
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no
We'll win but not everyone will get out
[Chorus]
East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control
East is up
[Outro]
I'm so high, so high
Fire, Nico and the Niners
I'm so high, so high

Fire, Nico and the Niners
Cut My Lip=

If you decide all is well
I'll keep on tryin', might as well (Might as well)
If you decide all is well (All is well)
[Pre-Chorus]
Though I am bruised, face of contusions
Know Iâ€™ll keep movin'
Though I am bruised, face of contusions
Know I'll keep movin', know I'll keep movin'
[Chorus]
Rust around the rim, drink it anyway
I cut my lip
Isn't what I want, blood is on my tongue
I cut my lip
[Verse 2]
I keep on goin' back
Even though itâ€™s me I abuse
Iâ€™ll keep on goin' back
Even...
[Pre-Chorus]
Though I am bruised, face of contusions
Know Iâ€™ll keep movin'
Though I am bruised, face of contusions
Know I'll keep movin', know Iâ€™ll keep movin'
[Chorus]
Rust around the rim, drink it anyway

Lean on my pride, I'm a lion

Lean on my pride, I'm a lion

Bandito=
[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito
[Verse 1]
This is the sound we make
When in between two places
Where we used to bleed
And where our blood needs to be
[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito
[Verse 2]
In City, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through
[Bridge]
Folina, Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina
I created this world to feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina, Sahlo
[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito (Sahlo)
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito
[Outro]
I created this world to feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina
Pet Cheetah=
[Verse 1]
I am on an island, no one to confide
Eight days straight, eight hours each and not one line
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So, I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise
[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
[Verse 2]
I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement
I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason
Statham, I've trained him to make me these beats
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet
I'ma get mine and get going
I'm showing my faces in just enough places
I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset
Will help us get ours as we're growing
This clique means so much to this dude
It could make him afraid of his music
And be scared to death he could lose it
[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
[Interlude]
I'll sit here 'til I
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem, no
I'll sit here 'til I
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
[Bridge]
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise
[Outro: Zack Joseph]
Pet cheetah, cheetah

Legend=
[Chorus]
You were one of those classic ones
Traveling around this sun
You were one of those classic ones
I wish she knew you
You were one of those classic ones
Now everybody knows
You were one of those classic ones, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Alright
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name, my goodbye
[Verse]
You were here when I wrote this
But the masters and mixes
Will take too long to finish to show you
I'm sorry I did not visit
Did not know how to take it
When your eyes did not know me
Like I know you
[Chorus]
You were one of those classic ones
Travelin' around this sun
You were one of those classic ones
I wish she knew you (I wish she knew you)
You were one of those classic ones
Now everybody knows (Wish she knew you)
You were one of those classic ones, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Alright
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name, my goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, oh
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Alright (wish she knew you)
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name, my goodbye
[Outro]
Then the day that it happened, I recorded this last bit
I look forward to having a lunch with you again
Leave the City=
[Verse 1]
I'm tired of tending to this fire
I've used up all I've collected
I have singed my hands
It's glowing, embers barely showing
Proof of life in the shadows
Dancing on my plans
[Chorus]
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
[Verse 2]
The burning is so low it's concerning
'Cause they know that when it goes out
It's a glorious gone
It's only time before they show me
Why no one ever comes back
With details from beyond
[Chorus]
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
(They know)
They know that it's almost over
(They know)
They know that it's almost over
(They know)
(They know)
(They know)
(They know)
[Bridge]
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
[Chorus]
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
(They know)
(They know)
[Verse 3]
Last year I needed change of pace
Couldn't take the pace of change
Moving hastily
But this year, though I'm far from home
In Trench I'm not alone
These faces facin' me
[Outro]
They know
They know
What I mean
