Overcompensate=
[Intro]
(Diese kleine unheimliche Insel hat mich zu einer Waffe gemacht)
(Wir glauben beide—)
(Cette petite île étrange a fait de moi une arme)
(Nous croyons tous les deux que nous pouvons l'utiliser pour changer l'élan de cette guerre)
(Esta pequeña isla espeluznante me ha convertido en un arma)
(Ambos creemos que podemos usarlo para cambiar el impulso de esta guerra)
Welcome back to Trench
Welcome back to Trench
[Break]
I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
[Verse 1]
Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react, acting
Gobsmacked, don't hesitate
To maybe overcompensate
I feel like I was just here, same twitchin' in my eyes
Don't sleep on a boy who can't fall asleep twice
In the same night, and won't hesitate
To maybe overcompensate
[Chorus]
I said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
[Verse 2]
Where am I from? I was born right here, just now
Originated right in front of your eyes
If you can't see, I am Clancy, prodigal son
Done running, come up with Josh Dun, wanted dead or alive
So now you pick who you serve, you bow to the masses
Get kicked to the curb for passin' the classes
Half empty, half full, save half for your taxes
Then overtake your former self
[Chorus]
I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
[Bridge]
Days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sake
Do the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul, corazón
The days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sake
Do the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul, corazón
[Refrain]
Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react, acting
Gobsmacked, don't hesitate
To maybe overcompensate
[Chorus]
I said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

No-no-no, no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no
[Verse 1]
Stand up straight now (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can't break down (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Graduate now (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here
It's a taste test (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Of what I hate less (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can you die of anxiousness? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here
What's about to happen? What's about to happen?
[Chorus]
I remember
I remember certain things
What I was wearin'
The yellow dashes in the street
I prayed those lights would take me home
Then I heard, "Hey, kid, get out of the road!" (Yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here
[Verse 2]
Can't feel my legs (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I might suffocate (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
There's a pressure in my chest (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here
What's about to happen? What's about to happen?
[Chorus]
I remember
I remember certain things
What I was wearin'
The yellow dashes in the street
I prayed those lights would take me home
Then I heard, "Hey, kid, get out of the road!"
[Refrain]
(Oh, woah, oh, oh-woah)
(Oh, woah, oh, oh-woah, oh)
Can't change what you've done
Start fresh next semester
[Chorus]
I remember
I remember certain things
What I was wearin'
The yellow dashes in the street
I prayed those lights would take me home
Then I heard, "Hey, kid, get out of the road!"
[Refrain]
(Oh, woah, oh, oh-woah) And then he slowed down
(Oh, woah, oh, oh-woah, oh) And rolled down his window
And he said
"Can't change what you've done
Start fresh next semester"
[Outro]
It's a taste test
Of what I hate less
I don't wanna be here
Start fresh with the new year
(Oh, ah, oh, oh-woah)
(Oh, ah, oh, oh-woah)
Can't change what you've done
Start fresh next semester
Backslide=
[Intro]
(I don't wanna)
[Verse 1]
Rat race, place to place, adding weight
Tendencies on repeat, innit?
Benefit from a shoe with no lace
Take the seat with the crease in it
I don't mind if it's lonely
I don't mind if it's fair
I don't care, you control me
Leading me anywhere
[Chorus]
I don't wanna backslide to where I've started from
There's no chance I will shake this again
'Cause I feel the pull, water's over my head
Strength enough for onе more time
Reach my hand abovе the tide
I'll take anything you have
If you could throw me a line
I should've loved you better
Do you think that now's the time
You should let go?
It's over my head
[Verse 2]
Bad place, on a hundred-dollar bass
Kinda wishin' that I never did "Saturday"
"Is that a stain? You should change
Are you doin' good?
Did you solve all of your problems?"
Thanks for asking, in a way, but
Accidentally uncovered a new one yesterday
What happened to what I brushed under the rug?
I used to be the champion of a world you can't see
Now I'm drowning in logistics
[Chorus]
I don't wanna backslide to where I've started from
There's no chance I will shake this again
'Cause I feel the pull, water's over my head
Strength enough for one more time
Reach my hand above the tide
I'll take anything you have
If you could throw me a line
I should've loved you better
Do you think that now's the time
You should let go?
[Bridge]
I don't mind if it's lonely (It's over my head)
I don't mind if it's fair (You should let go)
I don't care, you control me (It's over my head)
Leading me anywhere
[Chorus]
I'll take anything you have
If you could throw me a line
I should've loved you better
Do you think that now's the time
You should let go? (I don't mind if it's lonely)
It's over my head (I don't mind if it's fair)
You should let go
It's over my head
[Outro]
I don't wanna backslide
Midwest Indigo=
[Intro]
Reachin' out on my way home
You can be so cold, I'll try again
You make me sad and second-guess myself
You can be so cold
[Chorus]
Reachin' out on my way home
You can be so cold, I'll try again
You make me sad and second-guess myself
You can be so cold, Midwest Indigo
[Verse 1]
Running late so I didn't have the time
To scrape the frosted windshield like we're barely scrapin' by
Concentrate on the little gap in the ice
That seems to be about as wide as our chances
[Pre-Chorus]
Did you pull up yet? (Not yet)
Did you forgеt we're tight on time?
[Chorus]
Rеachin' out on my way home
You can be so cold, I'll try again
You make me sad and second-guess myself
You can be so cold, Midwest Indigo
[Verse 2]
Cloud coverage matched my outfit to a knife
I requested counsel with the counselor and he cancelled twice
It's a different blue, it's deeper than it's been
I'll be pulling into the parking lot before the heat kicks in
[Pre-Chorus]
What's your ETA? (Two minutes)
Chill out, man, we're right on time
[Chorus]
Reachin' out on my way home
You can be so cold, I'll try again
You make me sad and second-guess myself
You can be so cold, Midwest Indigo
[Outro]
And I want love and sunny days
I'm a bit too old to run away
You make me sad and second-guess myself
You can be so cold
You can be so cold
Midwest Indigo
Routines In The Night=
[Chorus]
Walk the layout, routines in the night
Some doors have "Stay out" spray-painted in white
While all the world's asleep, I walk around instead
Through the memories, down the halls of my head
Walk the layout, routines in the night
Some doors have "Stay out" spray-painted in white
While all the world's asleep, I walk around instead
Through the memories, down the halls of my head
[Verse 1]
Here comes a new night, but I'll send it through
I'll probably jump on the next one
I'm testing the limits of what a mind can do
I'm keeping my eyelids up, no mattеr what
[Pre-Chorus]
So beautiful, the space bеtween
A painful reminder and a terrible dream
I've been here before and I've got time
I'll give you the tour, show you why I
[Chorus]
Walk the layout, routines in the night
Some doors have "Stay out" spray-painted in white
While all the world's asleep, I walk around instead
Through the memories, down the halls of my head
[Verse 2]
Reoccurring, keeps comin' around
REM cycle skip, night psycho trip
It's reassuring you keep comin' around
It's tough to find good company
Reoccurring, days blurring
I'm still learning what this is (What this is, what this is, what this is)
Just keep me company
[Pre-Chorus]
So beautiful, the space between
A painful reminder and a terrible dream
I've been here before and I've got time
I'll give you the tour, show you why I
I'll show you why I
I'll show you why I
[Chorus]
Walk the layout (The layout), routines in the night (In the night)
Some doors have "Stay out" ("Stay out") spray-painted in white (In white)
While all the world's asleep (All the world asleep), I walk around instead
Through the memories (Through the memories), down the halls of my head
Walk the layout, routines in the night
Some doors have "Stay out" spray-painted (Oohh) in white
While all the world's asleep (All the world), I walk around instead
Through the memories, down the halls of my head
[Outro]
(Keeps comin' around, keeps comin' around, keeps comin' around)
(Lost in the halls of my head)
(Keeps comin' around, keeps comin' around, keeps comin' around)
(Lost in the halls of my head)
Vignette=
[Verse 1]
Not sure when it started, peelin' from his bones
Piece it back together all alone
Hope it held together long enough for he
To pitch the greener grasses and hope that she would agree
Fresh off a binger in the woods
Flesh covered in bites
Testing what is real, what is good
Man, it's been a long night
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a tribute to zombies of which I've become
Where do I go from here?
Where do I go from here?
[Chorus]
Clinging to promisеs
Fighting off the vignette
Tunnеls cave, visions fade
Swallowed by the vignette
[Verse 2]
He's thinking, "There's no way I'm headed there"
Always sure-footed, educated, and was never scared
Now he can't hold out his hand without it shaking
Hounded by a bunch of dead when the search party found him
Fresh off a binger in the woods
Flesh covered in bites
Testing what is real, what is good
Man, it's been a long night
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a tribute to zombies of which I've become
Where do I go from here?
Where do I go from here?
[Chorus]
Clinging to promises
Fighting off the vignette
Tunnels cave, visions fade
Swallowed by the vignette
[Post-Chorus]
No, not me, it's for a friend (Ooh)
No-no, not me, it's for a friend (Ooh)
No, not me, it's for a friend (Ooh)
No-no, not me, it's for a friend, denial
[Chorus]
Clinging to promises
Fighting off the vignette
Tunnels cave, visions fade
Swallowed by the vignette
[Post-Chorus]
No, not me, it's for a friend (Ooh)
No-no, not me, it's for a friend (Ooh)
No, not me, it's for a friend (Ooh)
No-no, not me, it's for a friend, denial
No, not me, it's for a friend
No-no, not me, it's for a friend
No, not me, it's for a friend
No-no, not me, it's for a friend, denial
The Craving (Jenna's version)=
[Intro: Jenna Joseph]
I don't know why I can't stop crying
And I'm thinking about getting old
And I don't know a lot about you still
[Verse 1]
Seems I get in my own way
The more I think, the less I say
I hope I communicate the craving
Now I see intentions don't mean much
[Chorus]
Say enough, say enough
Did I let her know, let her know?
If I found my body in chains
I'd lay down and wait
And hope she looks for me
And hope she looks for me-e-e-e-e
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Verse 2]
She just wants to catch a wave
Ride it out to the end of her days
I hope that I can satiate the craving
Now I see the gesture don't mean much
[Chorus]
Say enough, say enough
Did I lеt her know, let her know?
If I found my body in chains
I'd lay down and wait
And hopе she looks for me, mm
And hope she looks for me-e-e-e-e
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Bridge]
Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm
[Chorus]
Say enough, say enough
Did I let her know, let her know?
If I found my body in chains
I'd lay down and wait
'Cause it's the fear of the unknown
That cripples every step we take
And I just hate to put this on her
But I swear that I will give more than I take away
[Outro]
Mm
The craving
Now I see intentions don't mean much
Lavish=
[Intro]
Welcome to the new way of living
It's just the beginning of lavish (Feeling gourmet)
Welcome to the new way of living
It's just the beginning of lavish
From the floor to the ceiling
Welcome to the style you haven't seen in a while
It's lavish (Feeling gourmet)
[Verse 1]
You try your best to look like this is not your first time
You're fighting for the front row, that's a nice try
You're looking real nice, smelling like worth
Walking like you deserve it
And if your feet are hurting, then that's when you know
You brought the right equipment to put on a show
And let it flow, let it show, shine
Let it show, let it flow, shine
[Chorus]
Welcome to the new way of living
It's just the beginning of lavish
From the floor to the ceiling
Welcome to the style you haven't seen in a while
It's lavish (Feeling gourmet)
It's lavish
(Welcome to the new way of living it's just the beginning of lavish)
(Feeling gourmet)
It's lavish
(Welcome to the style you haven't seen in a while)
(It's lavish, Feeling gourmet)
(One, two, whistle)
(eltsihw, owt, enO)
[Verse 2]
Got that penny loafer squeak, across linoleum
Big flex, complex, Napoleon
I say whatever and whatever that I want
Sip a Capri-Sun like it's Dom Pérignon
I'm talking tough happily with someone in front of me
Room on the payroll, everyone can live comfortably
I'm coming in hot, hot shot hypocrisy
NDA's for the folks that talk to me
So tell your friends at follow "Bots Anonymous"
Keep it cool, keep the mood androgynous
I see your problem is your proctologist
Got both hands on your shoulder while you're bottomless
[Chorus]
It's lavish
It's lavish (Feeling-)
Welcome to the style you haven't seen in a while
It's lavish (Feeling gourmet)
[Outro]
(Welcome to the style you haven't seen in a while)
(It's lavish)
It's lavish

Eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh-oh

(Eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh)
(Eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh-oh)
My, oh my
Don't know how long it's been
My, oh my
[Verse 1]
I can't seem to turn the page
This haze around my face makes me feel all alone
I know you see me standin' still
But when our fingers touch, I feel my way back home
[Chorus]
Pardon my delay
I'm navigating, I'm navigating my head
Disassociate
I'm navigating, I'm navigating my head
Give me some advice
I am wasting all this time
My, oh my
Don't know how long it's been
My, oh my
[Verse 2]
How things change so rapidly
I find my self-esteem, then turn so cold
[Chorus]
Pardon my delay
I'm navigating, I'm navigating my head
Disassociate
I'm navigating, I'm navigating my head
Give me somе advice (Give me somе advice)
I am wasting all this time (Wasting)
My, oh my
Don't know how long it's been
[Bridge]
Since I responded to your question
If you really want to know what I'm thinkin'
Kind of feels like everybody leaves
Feelin' the reality that everybody leaves
My dad just lost his mom, I think that everybody leaves
And now I'm tryin' to hold onto you 'cause everybody leaves
[Chorus]
Pardon my delay
I'm navigating, I'm navigating my head
Disassociate
I'm navigating, I'm navigating my head
Give me some advice
I am wasting all this time
My, oh my
Pardon my delay
I'm navigating, I'm navigating my head
Disassociate
I'm navigating, I'm navigating my head
Give me some advice (Give me some advice)
I am wasting all this time (Wasting)
My, oh my
Snap Back=
[Chorus]
Got a bad feeling that I'm about to break
Been a good streak, but the pressure's overweight
Is it even good for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back
Got a bad feeling I'm gonna lose the lead
Runnin' from a thing that I kicked in '17
Is it even right for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back
[Verse 1]
Have I burnt all the bridges?
Bite the hand that helps me, give it finger stitches
Blacklisted from forgiveness
Fool you once, it's been twenty-five times
[Refrain]
It's a backslide
I commandeered a hot ride
Drove it 'til the engine died
All of that progress lost today
[Chorus]
Got a bad feeling that I'm about to break
Been a good streak, but the pressure's overweight
Is it even good for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back
Got a bad feeling I'm gonna lose the lead
Runnin' from a thing that I kicked in '17
Is it even right for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap b—
[Verse 2]
Oh it's you, well, welcome back to the show (Been a minute)
Guess I better move to a fresher approach (Thought I kicked it)
It's a new adaptation
[Refrain]
It's a backslide
I hate the surprise
And now it's all gone
All of that progress lost today
[Bridge]
I have seemed to run out of excuses of why I am this way
[Chorus]
Got a bad feeling that I'm about to break
Been a good streak, but the pressure's overweight
Is it even good for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back
Got a bad feeling I'm gonna lose the lead
Runnin' from a thing that I kicked in '17
Is it even right for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back
Then I gotta snap back
[Outro]
I've been prayin' for my elasticity to return to the way that it was
(If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back)
I've been prayin' for my elasticity to return to the way that it was
(If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back)
Oldies Station=
[Verse 1]
Only consistency in your periphery
Is fear and the bridge of your nose
And as you move about, you learn to tune 'em out
But they say they continue to grow
[Pre-Chorus]
Fear of the past and (Relative pain)
Future's comin' fast, you've got (Nothin' in the tank)
In a season of purging things you used to love
Everything must go, mm-hm
[Chorus]
Make an oath, then make mistakes
Start a streak you're bound to break
When darkness rolls on you
Push on through
Push on through
[Verse 2]
Then before you know, you lose some people close
Forcing you to manage your pace
Found your capacity for love and tragedy
Embracing how things always change
[Pre-Chorus]
You've had your turns with (Relative pain)
Little less concerned when there's (Nothin' in the tank)
In a season of lessons learned in giving up
You learn what you can and can't take, mm-hm
[Chorus]
Add some years, build some trust
You start to feel your eyes adjust
When darkness rolls on you
Push on through
Push on through
[Bridge]
You don't quite mind
You don't quite mind
You don't quite mind how long red lights are takin'
Push on through
Your favorite song was on the oldies station
Push on through
You have it down, that old fight for survival
Push on through
You're in the crowd at her first dance recital
Push on through
[Chorus]
Make an oath, then make mistakes
Start a streak you're bound to break
When darkness rolls on you
Push on through
[Outro]
Ooh

At The Risk Of Feeling Dumb=
[Chorus]
I don't want anyone, know me or not
See me at my lowest, you don't have to drop, drop, drop
Don't have to drop by
Nothin' you can do this time
I don't want anyone, know me or not
See me at my lowest, you don't have to drop
Drop, drop, drop anything for me
Just keep your plans, I hope that you never have to drop
[Verse 1]
Used to be you and me, matching Kawasaki Zs
Ride around 270 in Kawasaki tees
Two fighter jets matching energy
Trying to forget that we're in ejection seats
[Pre‐Chorus]
So please, keep it in mind
Check on your friends
Every once in a while
Even if they say
[Chorus]
I don't want anyone, know me or not
See mе at my lowest, you don't have to drop, drop, drop
Don't have to drop by
Nothin' you can do this timе
I don't want anyone, know me or not
See me at my lowest, you don't have to drop
Drop, drop, drop anything for me
Just keep your plans, I hope that you never have to drop
[Post-Chorus]
At the risk of feelin' dumb, check in
It's not worth the risk of losin' a friend
Even if they say
"Just keep your plans, I hope that you never have to drop"
[Verse 2]
If I'm bein' real, man, don't know how I feel, man
'Bout you sleepin' so close to a weapon you conceal, man
Those night terrors are not somethin' to take lightly
I know that it's a risk sayin' this, don't fight me
(Stoppin' me, fight me)
(Stoppin' me, fight me)
(Stoppin' me, fight me)
[Chorus]
I don't want anyone, know me or not
See me at my lowest, you don't have to drop, drop, drop me
Don't have to drop by
Nothin' you can do this time
I don't want anyone, know me or not
See me at my lowest, you don't have to drop
(Drop me, drop, drop me) Anything for me (Drop me, drop me)
Just keep your plans, I hope that you never have to drop
[Post-Chorus]
At the risk of feelin' dumb, check in
It's not worth the risk of losin' a friend
Even if they say
"Just keep your plans, I hope that you never have to drop"
[Chorus]
I don't want anyone, know me or not
See me at my lowest, you don't have to drop
Drop, drop, drop anything
For me
Paladin Strait=
[Verse 1]
I can't be alone
Guess I never told you so
Makin' my way towards you
Tracin' out a line
A route I've mapped a thousand times
Makin' my way towards you
[Chorus]
I would swim the Paladin Strait
Without any floatation
Just a glimpse of visual aid
Of you on the other shoreline
Waitin', expectations that I'm gonna make it
Mm-hm, hm-hm-hm
[Verse 2]
Standing on the shore
Staring down a hurtling storm
Makin' its way toward me
Water rips with rage
Endless row of angry waves
Makin' its way towards me
[Chorus]
I would swim the Paladin Strait
Without any floatation
Just a glimpse of visual aid
Of you on the other shoreline
Waitin', expectations that I'm gonna make it
Mm-hm, hm-hm-hm
[Bridge]
Here's my chance, time to take it
Can't be sure that I'll make it
Even though I'm past the point of no return
I'm all in, I'm surrounded
Put my money where my mouth is
Even though I'm past the point of no return
Here's my chance, time to take it
Can't be sure that I'll make it
Even though I'm past the point of no return
I'm all in, I'm surrounded
Put my money where my mouth is
Even though I'm past the point of no return
[Chorus]
I would swim the Paladin Strait
Without any floatation
Just a glimpse of visual aid
Of you on the other shoreline
Waitin', expectations that I'm gonna make it
Mm-hm, hm-hm-hm
[Break]
*Birds chirping*

On the ground are banditos
Fighting while I find Nico
Even though I'm past the point of no return
Climb the top of the tower
"Show yourself," I yell louder
Even though I'm past the point of no ret—
So few, so proud, so emotional
