Implicit Demand For Proof=
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I know You're not a liar and I know You could set fire this day
Go ahead and make me look away
Strike me down, I am calling Your lightning down from Your dark hiding place
Go ahead and show me Your face
[Chorus]
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down (Reign down)
[Verse 2]
I mean no disrespect
I am simply very perplexed by Your ways
Why would you let us use your name?
[Chorus]
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
[Outro]
Reign down (Down!)
Reign down (Down!)
Fall Away=
[Chorus]
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I'll keep the lights on in this place
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall a—way (La-da-da-da-da)
I don't wanna fall, fall a—way (La-da-da-da-da)
I don't, I don't wanna fall away (La-da-da-da-da)
I will keep the lights on in this place (La-da-da-da-da)
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away
[Verse 1]
I disguise and I will lie
And I will take my precious time
As the days melt away as I stand in line
And I die as I wait, as I wait on my crime
And I'll try to delay what you make of my life
But I don't want your way, I want mine
I'm dyin' and I'm tryin', but believe me, I'm fine
But I'm lyin', I'm so very far from fine
[Pre-Chorus]
And I, I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin, it will start
To break up and fall apart
[Chorus]
—way (La-da-da-da-da)
I don't wanna fall, fall away (La-da-da-da-da)
I don't wanna fall, fall away (La-da-da-da-da)
I will keep the lights on in this place (La-da-da-da-da)
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away
[Verse 2]
Every time I feel selfish ambition is takin' my vision
My crime is my sentence, repentance is taking commission
It's takin' a toll on my soul, I'm screaming submission and
I don't know if I am dying or living
'Cause I will save face for name's sake, abuse grace
Take aim to obtain a new name in a newer place
But my name is lame, I can't walk, and I ain't the same-a
And my name became a new destiny to the grave
[Pre-Chorus]
And I, I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin, it will start
To break up and fall apart
[Chorus]
—way (La-da-da-da-da)
I don't wanna fall, fall away (La-da-da-da-da)
I don't wanna fall, fall away (La-da-da-da-da)
I will keep the lights on in this place (La-da-da-da-da)
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away
[Outro]
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
The Pantaloon=
[Intro]
(Three, four)
[Verse 1]
Your grandpa died when you were nine
They said he had lost his mind
You have learned way too soon
You should never trust the Pantaloon
[Verse 2]
Now it's your turn to be alone
Find a wife and build yourself a home
You have learned way too soon
That your dad is now the Pantaloon
[Chorus]
You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind
[Bridge]
He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air, how
He used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a Pantaloon
[Chorus]
You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind
[Verse 3]
You like to sleep alone
It's colder than you know
'Cause your skin is so
Used to colder bones
It's warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmares and your frights
[Chorus]
You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends, they fertilize the ground you walk
So lose your mind
[Chorus]
You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends, they fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind
Addict With A Pen=
[Chorus]
Hello, we haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best of sons
Hello, I've been travelin' in the deserts of my mind
And I haven't found a drop of life
I haven't found a drop of You
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop of water
[Refrain]
Water
Oh
Oh
[Verse]
I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water in the palm of my hand
'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need
And the waves of the water mean nothing to me
But I try my best and all that I can to
Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
I'm just bein' dramatic, in fact, I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth, bindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again, see You tomorrow, but it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy, suicidal head-case
But You specialize in dyin', You hear me screamin', "Father!"
And I'm lyin' here just cryin', so wash me with Your water
[Refrain]
Water
Oh
[Chorus]
Hello, I haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best of sons
Hello, I've been travelin' in the deserts of my mind
And I, I haven't found a drop of life
I haven't found a drop of You
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop of water
Friend, Please=
[Verse 1]
I feel for you, but when did you believe you were alone?
You say that spiders crawled inside and made themselves a home
Where light once was
Petrified of who you are and who you have become
You will hide from everyone, denying you need
Someone to exterminate your bones
[Chorus]
Friend, please remove your hands
From over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave
But friend, please don't take your life away from me
[Verse 2]
Living like a ghost, you walk by everyone you know
You say that you're fine, but you have lost your sway and glow
So I stopped by to let you know
[Chorus]
Friend, please remove your hands
From over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave
But friend, please don't take your life away from me
[Bridge]
Would you let me know your plans tonight?
'Cause I just won't let go 'til we both see the light
And I have nothing else, oh, left to say
But I will listen to you all day
Yes, I will
[Outro]
Friend, please remove your hands
From over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave
But friend, please don't take your life away from me
March To The Sea=
[Verse 1]
There's miles of land in front of us
And we're dying with every step we take
We're dying with every breath we make
And I'll fall in line
A stranger's back is all I see
He's only a few feet in front of me
And I'll look left and right sometimes
But I'll fall in line
[Verse 2]
No one looks up anymore
'Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye
And Heaven forbid they see you cry
As we fall in line
And about this time of every year
The line will go to the ocean pier
And walk right off into the sea
And then we fall asleep
[Verse 3]
And as we near the end of land
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand
I ask myself the question why I fall in line
And then out of the corner of my eye
I see a spaceship in the sky
And hear a voice inside my head
[Chorus]
"Follow me instead"
"Follow me instead"
"Follow me"
[Verse 4]
Then the wages of war will start
Inside my head with my counterparts
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase
"This line's the only way"
And then I start down the sand
My eyes are focused on the end of land
But again the voice inside my head says
[Chorus]
"Follow me instead"
"Follow me instead"
"Follow me"
"Follow me instead"
"Follow me instead"
"Follow me instead"
"Follow me instead"
"Follow me instead"
[Verse 5]
Take me up, seal the door
I don't want to march here anymore
I realize that this line is dead
So I'll follow you instead
So then you put me back in my place
So I might start another day
And once again I will be
In a march to the sea
Johnny Boy=
[Verse 1]
He stays home from work this time
He never really told his wife
He never really told a lie
But this time, he decides that it's alright
It's alright
No one really knows his mind
And no one knows behind his eyes
The man deserves a medal
But he's never really won a prize before
He goes to lock the door
[Pre-Chorus]
He has fallen in love
He knows it's enough
But the world looks down and frowns
[Chorus]
Get up, Johnny Boy, get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny Boy, because we all need you now
We all need you now
[Verse 2]
Someone said, "Away you go!"
And someone said to you, "Goodbye."
They deflect the disrespect
When they say that they blame it on the times
They blame it on the times
We all know you're qualified
To fix a chair and love your wife
They all know you're qualified
But they lie when they blame it on the times
Oh, we blame it on the times
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, he has fallen in love
He knows it's enough
But the world looks down and frowns
[Chorus]
Get up, Johnny Boy, get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny Boy, because we all need you now
We all need you now
[Bridge]
I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame and
I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame and
I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame
[Chorus]
Get up, Johnny Boy, get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny Boy, because we all need you now
Get up, Johnny Boy, get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny Boy, because we all need you now
Oh Ms Believer=
[Verse 1]
Oh, Ms. Believer, my pretty sleeper
Your twisted mind is like snow on the road
Your shaking shoulders prove that it's colder
Inside your head than the winter of dead
[Verse 2]
I will tell you I love you
But the muffs on your ears will cater your fears
My nose and feet are running as we start
To travel through snow, together, we go
Together, we go
[Chorus]
We get colder as we grow older
We will walk so much slower
[Verse 3]
Oh, Ms. Believer, my pretty weeper
Your twisted thoughts are like snow on the rooftops
Please, take my hand, we're in foreign land
As we travel through snow, together we go
Together, we go
[Chorus]
We get colder as we grow older
Air Catcher=
[Verse 1]
I don't fall slow like I used to, I fall straight down
You've stolen my air catcher that kept me safe and sound
My parachute's what got me safely to ground
But now my cord's not workin' and I see you staring me down
[Chorus]
I won't fall in love with fallin'
I will try to avoid those eyes, oh
[Verse 2]
I think you would beat the moon in a pretty contest
And the moon just happened to be the very first thing that I missed
I was doing fine on my own and there wasn't much I lacked
But you've stolen my air catcher and I don't know if I want it back
[Chorus]
I won't fall in love with fallin'
I will try to avoid those eyes
'Cause I'm not sure I want to give you
Tools that can destroy my heart
[Bridge]
And I just don't say what you wanna hear
So I'll write my fears
And I don't believe in talkin' just to breathe
In fallin' selfishly
[Outro: Tyler Joseph, Nick Thomas & Chris Salih]
I won't fall in love with fallin'
I will try to avoid those eyes
But now I'm here to give you words as
Tools that can destroy my heart
Trapdoor=
[Verse 1]
He wakes up early today
Throws on a mask that will alter his face
Nobody knows his real name
But now he just uses one he saw on a grave
[Pre-Chorus]
And he pretends he's okay, but you should see, oh
Him in bed late at night, he's petrified
[Chorus]
Take me out, and finish this waste of a life
Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor
[Verse 2]
He thinks that faith might be dead
Nothing kills a man faster than his own head
He used to see dreams at night
But now he's just watching the backs of his eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
He pretends he's okay, but you should see
Him in bed late at night, he's petrified
[Chorus]
Take me out and finish this waste of a life
Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah!
[Bridge]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Take me out and finish this waste of a life
Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
When you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor
[Outro]
'Cause nobody knows he's alive
A Car, A Torch, A Death=
[Verse 1]
The air begins to feel a little thin
As I start the car and then I begin
To add the miles piled up behind me
I barely feel a smile deep inside me
[Verse 2]
And I begin to envy the headlights driving south
I wanna crack the door so I can just fall out
But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart
For me to drive away with
I began to understand why God died
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
The demon sat there waiting on her porch
It was a little dark, so he held a makeshift torch
And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night
[Bridge]
And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game
And then I saw him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said, "I'll take the grave
Please, just send them all my way"
Then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game
And then I saw him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said, "I'll take the grave
Please, just send them all my way"
[Refrain]
I began to understand why God died
[Verse 4]
The air begins to feel a little thin
As we're waiting for the morning to begin
But for now, you told me to hold this jar
And when I looked inside, I saw it held your heart
[Refrain]
For me to walk away with
I began to understand why God died
Taxi Cab=
[Verse 1]
I wanna fall inside your ghost
And fill up every hole inside my mind
And I want everyone to know
That I am half a soul divided
[Chorus]
Sometimes, we will die
And sometimes, we will fly away
Either way, you're by my side
Until my dyin' days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, "Don't be afraid"
I said, "Don't be afraid
We're goin' home"
[Verse 2]
I wanna strip myself of breath
A breathless piece of death I've made for you
A mortal rotting piece of song
Will help me carry on, but at least you heard
[Chorus]
Oh, sometimes, we will die
And sometimes, we will fly away
Either way, you're by my side
Until my dyin' days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, "Don't be afraid"
I said, "Don't be afraid
We're goin' home"
[Bridge]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Okay)
So the hearse ran out of gas
The passenger person grabbed a map
And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab
A beautifully planned taxi cab
A cab, had a cleared out back
And two men started to unpack
Driving once again, but now this time, there were three men
And then I heard one of them say
"I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
So he could see another day"
And then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more, pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the breath I was searchin' for
Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked, "Am I alive and well
Or am I dreaming dead?"
Then one turned around to say
"We're driving toward the morning, son
Where all your blood is washed away
And all you did will be undone"
[Outro]
I said, "Don't be afraid"
I said, "Don't be afraid"
Oh, oh
Before You Start Your Day=
[Verse 1]
Open the slits in your face
And start your day
You don't have much time
To make your slits look just right
[Refrain]
I'm in your mind
I'm singin'
I'm in your mind
I'm singin'
La-da, la-da
La-da, la-da
La-da
La-da-da
[Verse 2]
Look in the mirror and ask your soul
If you're alright
Put on the glitter
That your soul hides behind
[Refrain]
You're in my mind
I'm singin'
You're in my mind
I'm singin'
La-da, la-da
La-da, la-da
La-da
La-da-da
[Bridge]
Know you were made holy
Open up your eyes and see
The clouds above will hold you
The clouds above will sing
[Outro]
And in your mind
You're singing
La-da, la-da
La-da, la-da
La-da
La-da-da
Isle Of Flightless Birds=
[Intro]
(La, da, da, da)
(La, da, da, da, da)
(La, da, da, da, la, da, da, la)
(La, da, da, da)
(La, da, da, da, da, da, da)
(La, da, da, da, la, da, daa, la-a-a-a-a-a,-a-a)
[Verse 1]
Now is the climax to the story
That gives the demons and angels purpose
They fly around while we are walking
And mold our emotions just to please them
[Chorus]
I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing
Plummet as I sing
[Verse 2]
All we are is an isle of flightless birds
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff
We're lining our homes against winding roads
And we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing
Remind us of things that nobody cares about
And honestly, we're probably
More suicidal than ever now
If you decide to live by
What you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me, you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning
And decide what we believe
We can take apart our very heart
And the light will set us free
[Chorus]
I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I
I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I
[Verse 3]
How frustrating and so degrading
His time, we're wasting as time will fly by
And the sky will cry as light is fading
And He is waiting, oh, so patiently
While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability
And please think about why you can't sleep, uh, in the evening
And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle
And I promise you, this is mine
(I promise you, this is mine)
