Ode to Sleep=
[Verse 1]
I wake up fine and dandy, but then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, "Please, oh please!" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one, be the one who has the
Sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone
[Chorus]
But I'll tell 'em, "Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant"
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell 'em
[Verse 2]
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, "There's something we need!"
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone
[Chorus]
But I'll tell 'em, "Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant"
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
[Outro]
I'll tell 'em, you have no plans for me, I will set my soul on fire
What have I become? I'll tell 'em, I'll tell 'em, I'll tell 'em
I'll tell 'em, please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become? I'm sorry
Holding on to You=
[Verse 1]
I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost, "T"'s uncrossed and "I"'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it, I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul
[Break]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
[Post-Chorus]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
And I'll be holding on to you
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
And I'll be holding on to you
[Verse 2]
Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine
And tie it to a tree, tell it, "You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me"
[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
[Bridge]
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
[Breakdown]
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts and it's our hearts that make the beat
[Outro]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
And I'll be holding on to you, and I'll be holding on to you
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
And I'll be holding on to you, and I'll be holding on to you
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
And I'll be holding on to you, and I'll be holding on to you
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
And I'll be holding on to you, and I'll be holding on to you
Migraine=
[Intro]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone
[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far, kid
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Bullet tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive, you gotta kill your mind
[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far, kid
[Post-Chorus]
(Ah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone
[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know, oh
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far, kid
[Outro]
I've made it this far
I've made it this fâ€”
House of Gold=
[Chorus]
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"
I will make you queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map, I'll cure you of disease
[Verse 1]
Let's say we up and left this town
And turned our future upside down
We'll make pretend that you and me
Lived ever after happily
[Chorus]
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"
I will make you queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map, I'll cure you of disease
[Verse 2]
And since we know that dreams are dead
And life turns plans up on their head
I will plan to be a bum
So I just might become someone
[Chorus]
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"
I will make you queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map, I'll cure you of disease
Car Radio=
[Refrain]
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
[Verse 1]
Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel
[Refrain]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
[Verse 2]
I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And-a from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one, please, because
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think
[Refrain]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
[Bridge]
(Woah, oh-oh-oh)
(Woah, oh-oh-oh)
(Woah, oh-oh-oh)
(Woah, oh-oh-oh)
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit
[Refrain]
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
Semi-Automatic=
[Verse 1]
Night falls, with gravity
The Earth turns, from sanity
Taking my only friend I know
He leaves a lot, his name is Hope
[Chorus]
I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside
[Verse 2]
The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on
My shadow grows taller along with my fears
And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near
When the sun is climbing window sills
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun makes the hills its grave
[Chorus]
I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside
I'm never what I like!
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind
[Breakdown]
I'm semi-automatic
My prayer's schizophrenic
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on
I'm semi-automatic
My prayer's schizophrenic
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'm semi-automatic
My prayer's schizophrenic
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on
I'm semi-automatic
My prayer's schizophrenic
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on...
[Bridge]
By the time the night wears off, the dust is down
And shadows burn
I will rise and stand my ground
Waiting for the night's return
[Chorus]
I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside
I'm never what I like!
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind
Screen=
[Verse 1]
I do not know why I would go
In front of you and hide my soul
'Cause you're the only one who knows it
Yeah, you're the only one who knows it
And I will hide behind my pride
D-don't know why I think I could lie
'Cause there's a screen on my chest
Yeah there's a screen on my chest
[Chorus]
(Oh) I'm standing in front of you
(Oh) I'm standing in front of you
(Oh-oh-oh) I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
(Oh) I'm standing in front of you
(Oh) Oh, I'm standing in front of you
(Oh-oh-oh) I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
[Verse 2]
I can't see past my own nose
I'm seeing everything in slo-mo
Look out below crashing down to the ground
Just like a vertical locomotive, that's a train
Am I painting the picture that's in my brain?
A train from the sky, locomotive, my motives are insane
My flow's not great, okay, I conversate with people
Who know if I flow on a song, I'll get no radio play
While you're doing fine, there's some people and I
Who have a really tough time getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky
[Chorus]
(Oh) I'm standing in front of you
(Oh) I'm standing in front of you
(Oh-oh-oh) I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool (I'm standing)
(Oh) I'm standing in front of you (I'm standing)
(Oh) Oh I'm standing in front of you (I'm standing)
(Oh-oh-oh) Oh I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
[Bridge]
Ooh, oooh
Oh-oh-oh, mm
We're broken, we're broken
We're broken, we're broken people
We're broken people, yeah
We're broken, we're broken
We're broken, we're broken people
We're broken people, yeah
We're broken, we're broken
We're broken, we're broken people
We're broken people, yeah
[Chorus]
(Stand) I'm standing in front of you (We're broken, we're broken)
(Stand) I'm standing in front of you (We're broken, we're broken people, oh)
(Stand) I'm trying to be so cool (We're broken people, oh, yeah)
(Stand) Everything together trying to be so cool
(I'm standing) I'm standing in front of you (We've broken, we've broken)
(I'm standing) Oh, I'm standing in front of you (We've broken, we've broken people, oh)
(I'm standing, ooh-ooh) Oh, I'm trying to be so cool (We've broken people, oh, yeah)
Everything together trying to be so cool
The Run and Go=
[Verse 1]
I can't take them on my own, my own
Pa, I'm not the one you know, you know
I have killed a man and all I know is
I am on the run and go
[Chorus]
Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay
[Post-Chorus]
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do
[Verse 2]
I am up against the wall, the wall
Pa, I hear them coming down the hall
I have killed a man and all I know is
I am on the run and go
[Chorus]
Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay
[Post-Chorus]
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do, do, do
[Bridge]
Cold nights under siege from accusations
Cerebral thunder and one-way conversations
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay
[Outro]
Tonight, I'll need you to stay
Tonight, I'll need you to stay
Tonight, I'll need you to stay
Tonight, I'll need you to stay!
Fake You Out=
[Verse 1]
I want to drive away
In the night, headlights call my name
Iâ€”
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never be, be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far
[Chorus]
And I'll fall, and I'll break
And I'll fake, all I wanna
(Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey...)
And I'll fall down, and I'll break down
And I'll fake you out, all I wanna
[Verse 2]
I'm so afraid of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now and silence gives you space
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never be, be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far
[Chorus]
And I'll fall, and I'll break
And I'll fake, all I wanna
(Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey...)
And I'll fall down, and I'll break down
And I'll fake you out, all I wanna
[Bridge]
It's the same game today as it always is
I don't give these places fake my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
That remind me of all the times
I have committed dirty, dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted
To what I've done and what I'm doing
I'm brewing and losing and spewing and fusing
And believe me, that's what all the kids are doing
What kids are doing, they're killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner cell
And if you're one of them, then you're one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free
Yeah, am I right? Of course I am, convince me otherwise would take all night
Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say
Our brains are sick but that's okay
[Chorus]
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out, I'll break you down)
(I'll fake you out)
And I'll fall (I'll fake you out)
And I'll break (I'll fake you out)
And I'll fake (I'll fake you out)
All I wanna (All I wanna)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out, I'll break you down)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll break you down)
All I wanna
Yeah, and I'll fall down, and I'll break down (I'll fake you out)
And I'll fake you out, all I wanna
Yeah, and I'll fall down, and I'll break down
And I'll fake you out, all I wanna
[Outro]
I'm so afraid of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now and silence gives you space
Guns for Hands=
[Verse 1]
I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone
And you swear to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know, I know-ow-ow
What that means, I know-ow-ow-ow-ow
[Pre-Chorus]
That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it
[Chorus]
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
[Verse 2]
Let's take this a second at a time
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme
Together, let's breathe
Together, to the beat
But there's hope out the window
So that's where we'll go
Let's go outside and all join hands
But until then you'll never understand
[Pre-Chorus]
That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it (Don't take it)
[Chorus]
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoo!
(Da-da da-da-da)
(Da-da da-da-da)
(Da-da da-da-da, ah uh)
(Da-da da-da-da)
[Bridge]
We've turned our hands to guns
Traded our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music
It's obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist
[Chorus]
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
Trees=
[Verse]
I know where You stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Silent in the trees
Why won't You speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly
[Chorus]
I can feel Your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know You
I want to see
I want to say
Hello, hello
Hello, oh, hello
[Refrain]
Da da, da da da, da-da
Da da, da da da, da-da
Da da, da da da, da-da
Da da, da da da, da-da

I know where You stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Silent in the trees
Why won't You speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly
[Chorus]
I can feel Your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know You
I want to see
I want to say
[Refrain]
Hello (Da da, da da da, da-da
Da da, da da da, da-da)
Hello (Da da, da da da, da-da

Truce=
[Verse 1]
Now the night is coming to an end
(Ooh)
The sun will rise and we will try again
(Ooh)
[Chorus]
Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die
[Verse 2]
I will fear the night again
(Ooh)
I hope I'm not my only friend
(Ooh)
[Chorus]
Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
